5
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:07.740
Andrea Vona: I have been with the county of Los Angeles, for three years in this capacity, my involvement with the or LP program with for as it relates to our department, would be to.

6
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:27.570
Andrea Vona: apply for funding through their grant programs for program for projects within the county and I have it my experience to date is really with one we've we've had one successful award so we're currently in the process of.

7
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.020
Andrea Vona: Congress negotiations and conversations with state parks and NPs around this.

8
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.580
Andrea Vona: Hopefully upcoming grant award so that's I think that today answer all those questions okay.

9
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:56.820
Clement Lau | DPR: hi my name is clements wow i'm i'm the head of our planning and sequence section at Los Angeles county parks and recreation.

10
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.390
Clement Lau | DPR: been with the department for about 15 years and my section.

11
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.480
Clement Lau | DPR: And those long range planning, as well as governmental compliance.

12
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.620
Clement Lau | DPR: So we work closely with with Andrew on grant applications.

13
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:28.500
Clement Lau | DPR: yeah its various projects, especially with respect to compliance with cbre and deeper with the Federal grants.

14
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.200
Clement Lau | DPR: In world and.

15
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.350
Clement Lau | DPR: limited experience with this particular grant program is the same project that Andrea mentioned.

16
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.210
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah Thank you so much, and now we.

17
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:54.240
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): can go into the questions, and so our first question is on this first project that la county was awarded it was the ford's theatre hiking trail for getting a research project on.

18
00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.850
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And so we're wondering what was the general experience in applying for this program on any initial thoughts before we ask specific questions.

19
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.490
I think the general.

20
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.270
Andrea Vona: I think the general experience and applying for the program because this it's administered through the state.

21
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.980
Andrea Vona: it's it was and it seemed like the state.

22
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.540
Andrea Vona: Is state parks, is working to try to make.

23
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:43.800
Andrea Vona: The application as user friendly as possible, and so it was it seemed fairly in alignment with other with possibly with other competitive state park applications, I mean it wasn't overly a typical like I said would say in that regard.

24
00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.740
Andrea Vona: i'm trying to remember, because it's like benefit a couple years now since.

25
00:03:50.700 --> 00:04:07.260
Andrea Vona: yeah I saw I guess your that was your question like just general impressions of the yeah, but I think I don't know you might have more questions later on, but it's it's less clear up front when you're applying, though, when you would be awarded and what there's less there's less.

26
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:17.340
Andrea Vona: it's definitely unknown like what the overall timeline is, which is, which is a typical just which is unusual, so that was different.

27
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.700
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah Thank you Clement if you have anything.

28
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.800
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): To add or not necessarily.

29
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:41.760
Clement Lau | DPR: yeah I mean I share that most most of the input you're going to get probably from Andrea histories and those grants section on my it's pretty focused on the mental compliant.

30
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.190
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Okay, great.

31
00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.380
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): So our next question is.

32
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:55.500
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): What components of or LP do you think our work like worked well, while you are applying and why do you think these things might have works well.

33
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:06.660
Andrea Vona: oops I thought I would pull up maybe our application so I can.

34
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.600
Andrea Vona: Have a refresh but um.

35
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.270
Andrea Vona: Because I honestly don't even remember all of the questions we have so many applications.

36
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.450
Kitty Craig (she/her): into a bit while while you're doing it, I was just curious I know y'all were awarded are all stored.

37
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:30.180
Kitty Craig (she/her): In her the hiking trail and but were there have you also applied before in previous rounds and we're not afforded that was history that we didn't have.

38
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:47.670
Andrea Vona: No, I will I can't I don't know I could look up our departmental history and see we have we have our department definitely has been the recipient of several lw cf grants over the years, but it the rfp program is different correct.

39
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.510
Kitty Craig (she/her): Yes, yes.

40
00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.020
Andrea Vona: So I don't know that we have.

41
00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:01.560
Andrea Vona: i'm not aware that we have implemented any other or LP grants and I personally, we have, at least in the past three years hadn't applied for any.

42
00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:18.780
Andrea Vona: Other ones so it's like my This is my one yeah correct we hadn't This was our first application and then for successful, but I will say I don't know if this is valuable in fell because I mean I feel like I should just like tell you the story and i'd probably answer, like all your questions.

43
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.720
Andrea Vona: Because we apply we applied and.

44
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.620
Andrea Vona: that's why I was trying to look at my files, because we applied in.

45
00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:44.400
Andrea Vona: Well i'll look up the years later, but it took so because we had a we had a grant submission into them for or LP and a whole year had gone by, and we still hadn't heard, whether that was successful or not successful, we were encouraged to apply again.

46
00:06:45.930 --> 00:07:01.590
Andrea Vona: So we actually had to apply twice and then they decided to award the first application and so that was like you know technically waste of time to apply twice if that makes sense, so I guess i've applied twice, but it was all the same project.

47
00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.210
Andrea Vona: So that's what I was getting at with timelines.

48
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.030
Andrea Vona: Earlier, let me look what find try to find this.

49
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:29.610
Andrea Vona: yeah brown hair so yeah we applied in 2020 the 2020 I guess application was awarded, and then we also apply to get in 2021 because we didn't know that are at that point that are 2020 would be awarded.

50
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:37.260
Andrea Vona: And then they had been they rejected our 2021 application, because they were decided to award the 2020.

51
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:50.190
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah, thank you for telling us that background, were there any other challenges to applying to funding, besides the.

52
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:53.220
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): timeline applying twice.

53
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.540
Andrea Vona: yeah I mean I.

54
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.410
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): I think.

55
00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:58.920
Andrea Vona: I mean, I can get into challenges on what I think the challenges.

56
00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:07.500
Andrea Vona: That I assume will be questions later about like challenges with the program and implementation of the program, but I think in terms of applying I don't recall any.

57
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.590
Andrea Vona: specific challenges.

58
00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:23.220
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And so, did the state parks, did they work with you like frequently they had like a lot of communication with you throughout the process, or was it mostly just a straightforward application on like grants.gov.

59
00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:30.630
Andrea Vona: um know what it was the our submission went in state parks and they were their project team was helpful.

60
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:42.840
Andrea Vona: I had several questions for them around the match the 50% match requirements and what could count what would constitute a match and the timeline around the match, and they were.

61
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:53.520
Andrea Vona: held the state park staff was responsive and willing to have phone calls or was definitely respond to emails so our submission goes and went into state parks and then they.

62
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:59.670
Andrea Vona: I think they repackage them and then send them to MPs, is my understanding.

63
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:24.000
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah Thank you and then I think one last general question is so right now, on average, around 25% of all the funding is not utilize each grant cycle around 25% funds are left on the table um So if you have any inclination as to why cities or urban areas are not applying for this funding.

64
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.940
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): um.

65
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:44.280
Andrea Vona: yeah I mean this might be whether or not I can I guess i'll just share my general feedback on the program I don't know if this is why people are not applying, but I think some of the issues with the program are you apply and then it takes.

66
00:09:46.740 --> 00:10:04.590
Andrea Vona: You know, like we're expecting slash hoping to get just as an example of grant contract, this summer, which would be summer of 2022 we applied in 2020 so it probably takes about two years from when you apply to get an actual grant contract, so that is.

67
00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:17.190
Andrea Vona: That timeline often that may not be so the length of time that it might take for someone to receive funds, the I don't know the match requirement.

68
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:22.950
Andrea Vona: And I think there's a CAP, the amount of money so there's a match required.

69
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:32.160
Andrea Vona: I mean here's the whole deal they want very specific cost estimates, they want everything very specific specific budgets and then you're required to provide a match.

70
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.480
Andrea Vona: But you can't.

71
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:39.780
Andrea Vona: there's a CAP as to how much of that Max you can have spent within I think like a couple years of the application.

72
00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:49.680
Andrea Vona: So you need to have like a really well developed project, you need to have all the funding almost all in place, because they want to see the full funding picture, but you can't really have spent much of that money yet.

73
00:10:51.300 --> 00:11:04.680
Andrea Vona: And then you can't spend it until like you're on contract with them, which takes a long time to get to, so I think I think successful applicants are going to be those that have the luxury of time and that are already resourced, with their project.

74
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:17.040
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Yes, thank you, I think that falls into our next question, most of the questions this one I usually get the same answer for but who asked.

75
00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:28.380
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Does the design of oral P help ensure funds are being directed to communities that are most in need of this additional funding for improved or more outdoor recreation.

76
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:41.340
Andrea Vona: I don't see anything in particular that's really helping the funds be targeted towards communities most in need, other than I think.

77
00:11:41.730 --> 00:12:01.020
Andrea Vona: This is where I definitely could be incorrect, I think it, the funds are targeted towards urban census tracts or something Is that correct so there's that component which I suppose so so but in terms of I think what your question just said is the program designed I don't.

78
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:12.150
Andrea Vona: I don't see evidence of that, I mean I don't I don't have anything else to point to other than it's it's being focused toward urban communities.

79
00:12:13.650 --> 00:12:15.450
Andrea Vona: i'm not sure if that answers your question.

80
00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:17.490
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah um.

81
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:24.240
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah I was like we could go on to the next question to which is on like their definitions of underserved communities which.

82
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:32.640
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): have been changing each cycle, they released the notice of funding opportunity with a new definition each cycle.

83
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:40.440
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And if you would like we've like captured on what these definitions look like, so we could send them in the chat right now.

84
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.310
Okay.

85
00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:51.420
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And this is just um something me and kitty have pulled together like we've created ourselves to track what it means to be a underserved.

86
00:12:51.900 --> 00:13:03.090
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Community mm hmm and I know la county seems to do like a lot in terms of definitions and like California does as well, I saw like like in 2016 we did you guys did park needs assessment.

87
00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:09.270
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And so, in terms of like the hiking trail project, how did you guys just.

88
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.020
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): determine like or define an underserved community.

89
00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:15.630
Andrea Vona: We looked at.

90
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:20.610
Andrea Vona: it's not opening for some reason for me so i'll have to look at the definitions later, but.

91
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:32.280
Andrea Vona: We looked at, we looked at census tract information, and I think we used was an SP we used just DAC an s dot community.

92
00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:41.280
Andrea Vona: identifications within census tracts that were within half a mile of the park site and so that was the link.

93
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:57.930
Andrea Vona: And part of our justification was also because it's a regional park the park that we're supporting, so I think overall where the park is located, it is not in a high park need area but because regional parks, have a large service radius and serve.

94
00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:03.180
Andrea Vona: A broader geography of people that was that was what we used.

95
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:16.050
Andrea Vona: You know, and then, and also in terms of the high need Community concept or or just sort of underserved communities often I think sometimes these faces haven't really.

96
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:24.120
Andrea Vona: FLEX the muscles around like trying to access all these funds and it's a it's sort of a complicated program to administer.

97
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:31.710
Andrea Vona: as well because you're tied out now you have federal funds touching a project and that triggers on the planet is you know.

98
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:44.550
Andrea Vona: Also, can speak to but it triggers a different level of environmental review that's it, you know cities may or may not have familiarity with in terms of nepa and section 106 so it adds you know the.

99
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:56.490
Andrea Vona: By virtue of receiving and orla grant it added it actually also adds cost to our project, because now we have additional environmental review, so I mean that could also be a barrier for people.

100
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:09.480
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah and the census tract data that you look at on do you look at like a specific tables like poverty level or race or, if you could give like a specific on.

101
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.240
Andrea Vona: tables we i'd have to look at our.

102
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.360
Andrea Vona: Application I think yeah we looked at this let's see their application.

103
00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.320
Andrea Vona: win a prize should get back to you on this question, but we look at.

104
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.850
Andrea Vona: I think it's it's in line with the the.

105
00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:36.240
Andrea Vona: The criteria for for disadvantaged communities and severely disadvantaged communities those definitions.

106
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:41.430
Andrea Vona: Under is it SP 32.

107
00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:43.350
Andrea Vona: That made that.

108
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.530
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And I can't remember I know it's on it.

109
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.590
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Okay yeah.

110
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:56.010
Andrea Vona: that's the that was so we weren't creating our own definition, you know we were working with.

111
00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.320
Andrea Vona: Those established definitions, as a way to show.

112
00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:04.950
Andrea Vona: Impact to those groups.

113
00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:26.610
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah Okay, and then another thing and orlev applications is that they require a quantification of like job development or job creation, I was wondering um how this like application, how you guys quantify that there's some sort of calculator you guys use I know it's a little bit ambiguous.

114
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:38.490
Andrea Vona: yeah I think part I mean maybe where we part of what helped us for this application, and I think being the county We already have a lot of kind of workforce development.

115
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:51.330
Andrea Vona: policies in place and because this particular project falls above a certain budget threshold, there is, and I was going to try to pull this up my computer is spinning.

116
00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:54.870
There it is.

117
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.270
Andrea Vona: There were already.

118
00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:17.760
Andrea Vona: Things that we are complying with in terms of work force, development and a jobs coordinator position to be added as a part of this project, and so we had some quantification, but it is difficult, like we're not able to quantify the exact number of people that gets very difficult.

119
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:26.790
Andrea Vona: i'm sorry Mike, this is not letting me search, but basically we tied it back to.

120
00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:34.410
Andrea Vona: We tied it back to two things we tied it back to working with a conservation corps and the workforce development that will happen as part of their.

121
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:42.660
Andrea Vona: involvement and being contracted to implement a part of the project and also tied it to the existing county workforce development policies that are in place.

122
00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:55.950
Andrea Vona: With there's like targeted local worker hires within certain zip code radius is of projects and other things, that the county has established so we just tend to restate that that back in our application.

123
00:17:56.610 --> 00:18:04.020
Andrea Vona: So I think in some ways that made it easier for us to respond to that question because we we already are.

124
00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:13.890
Andrea Vona: Pretty proactive around that I know clever do you have anything to add that you might be more familiar with our workforce policies, I don't know.

125
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:18.960
Clement Lau | DPR: um no definitely not workforce.

126
00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:28.200
Andrea Vona: Sorry yeah and i'm happy to like send you that excerpt to have that's abuse, but that's That is how we respond to that question.

127
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:43.560
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah definitely that'd be helpful, especially like NPs or the state parks if they didn't like give you any feedback or any pushback on that I know in terms of like other applicants, they were saying that.

128
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:49.800
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): I was quite confusing and they got like a feedback they weren't like they didn't know how to respond to.

129
00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:52.020
Andrea Vona: So, though interesting.

130
00:18:52.530 --> 00:19:00.060
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah yeah trying to create like a recommendation for like perhaps you know la county can set a standard for what this means.

131
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:09.570
Andrea Vona: yeah, although I don't know because ours is so complicated it's like it's like they look at, I think it looks at me income within.

132
00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:22.710
Andrea Vona: You know zip code radius is and targeted local worker hiring I mean that might be really complicated for smaller cities to implement, so I don't hate to yeah but maybe I will i'll send you what we sent them and then.

133
00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:24.870
Andrea Vona: If that's useful.

134
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:32.400
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah because it could be beyond what a parks department could even do that's a whole other office to bring into this.

135
00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:39.960
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Which is a yeah an issue in many smaller urban areas or underserved urban areas.

136
00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:45.150
Andrea Vona: Yes, yeah where there's this very minimal city staff right it's hard.

137
00:19:49.380 --> 00:20:03.900
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah Thank you um and then I think we already touched on this a little bit, but if you could describe your experience what was like working with the California department of perks and rock and NPs if you did you contact like order.

138
00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.720
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Have any communication with NPs during this process, or is all through California hearts.

139
00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:26.610
Andrea Vona: Not that I recall, I believe all of our communication has been through State parks, you know email or phone or teams meetings and they're kind of serving as a conduit and then they will relate to us feedback that NPs has for us to respond to.

140
00:20:28.590 --> 00:20:32.520
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah and then how was that experience working with them the state parks i'm.

141
00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.260
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): gonna.

142
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.140
Andrea Vona: Say perks is great, I mean I yeah I feel like this.

143
00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.780
Andrea Vona: shape works has been helpful and responsive.

144
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:54.570
Andrea Vona: I think they're doing the best they can to sort of take this program and make it accessible and be responsive so that yeah they've been they've been responsive and.

145
00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.440
Andrea Vona: helpful state park staff yeah.

146
00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:05.310
Andrea Vona: um yeah it's just I get it sometimes I don't know that.

147
00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:15.480
Andrea Vona: yeah so sometimes we'll we'll respond and then submit it to state parks and then it'll go to NPs and then they'll have questions and i'll go back to state parks will come back to us so.

148
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.870
Andrea Vona: Sometimes things take a while to.

149
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:24.090
Andrea Vona: Get resolved, but it's they've been responsive.

150
00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:33.600
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah that's great it seems like California state parks i'm definitely has it together in terms of parks and nationally.

151
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:49.350
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And then, our next question is around Community engagement and what this looks like through that um there's a hiking trail project, how you engage with the Community what sort of like steps you took to have meaningful engagement.

152
00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:58.260
Andrea Vona: So I think part of what enabled us to also apply for this grant is that we This project was.

153
00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:13.740
Andrea Vona: Like already kind of fully conceptualized and designed and with very accurate cost estimates, and so there we really kind of just captured in our application, a lot of engagement that had occurred which was.

154
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:24.330
Andrea Vona: There was engagement in the master plan process for the four theaters master plan and there had been some engagement well in 2016 for the park needs assessment.

155
00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:33.570
Andrea Vona: folks commenting about meeting at more Ada accessibility or different things, so we really kind of just captured the work that had already been done.

156
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:43.410
Andrea Vona: We were not able to do engagement just for this this application like it wasn't specific to this for this grant, but it was for the project in general.

157
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:57.540
Andrea Vona: So we kind of summarize that back in our application and that's what we did, but I think, just as a general comment, it seems like from just a lot of these larger competitive brands.

158
00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:10.440
Andrea Vona: As a grants person I always just find it helpful if it's always so helpful if, like the project is already established as a project and a lot of the engagement has happened because there's not.

159
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:16.470
Andrea Vona: We don't have a lot of time always to prepare the applications and so it's hard to be doing.

160
00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:28.380
Andrea Vona: Things as meaningful as Community engagement, while you're trying to prepare grant hmm so it's nice to know you already have to buy into the Community ahead of time and that those things have happened already.

161
00:23:29.130 --> 00:23:34.260
Andrea Vona: Nothing engagement lever ends, but you know at least what's documented for the application.

162
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:50.820
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah that's great to hear and also something I just thought about was We talked to California state parks and they were mentioning like concept papers around projects, I was wondering if you submitted any of that or if they implemented the concept paper.

163
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:57.630
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): In other grants cycles I I couldn't tell if it was like a new thing that the State parks was asking for.

164
00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.600
Andrea Vona: I don't know they call it a concept paper.

165
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.680
huh.

166
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:14.940
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): For just like parks that could potentially be eligible for like i'll wtf are all P or other kinds of fundings to having sort of concept papers to send out so, then the parks can match it with a grant Program.

167
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:22.110
Andrea Vona: Oh, I haven't heard so it's something that state parks would produce and give out to people, or it goes the other way.

168
00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:23.730
Andrea Vona: That they would submit to them.

169
00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.390
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah they like have like a call for concepts papers and then.

170
00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.240
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Their contacts get back to them that way.

171
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:31.710
Andrea Vona: Oh OK.

172
00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:35.460
Kitty Craig (she/her): I think part of that's driven by acknowledging.

173
00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:42.480
Kitty Craig (she/her): That these application processes can take a really long time so they're trying to kind of help people build a pipeline.

174
00:24:43.710 --> 00:24:51.180
Kitty Craig (she/her): Like get through some of these hurdles anyway, so they might not run into them later and slows the process down even more, I think.

175
00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.800
Kitty Craig (she/her): yeah part of the driver.

176
00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.420
Andrea Vona: yeah I mean I could have missed that I don't know I mean I knew that like.

177
00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:03.840
Andrea Vona: We try as good practice it's kind of good to like slope the concept by like before you just spend all the work.

178
00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.280
Andrea Vona: In an application like.

179
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:13.890
Andrea Vona: To be in touch with someone and say does this sound like a good fit for your program which we probably did that I don't remember candidly but um.

180
00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:21.690
Andrea Vona: But yeah that makes sense, so they're trying to queue up like for or look what yeah that makes sense.

181
00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:45.480
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah um and then our next question is on what other like grant programs or initiative says la county utilize that like overlap with or schools and increasing outdoor recreation to urban or economically disadvantaged or underserved communities, if you guys have any existing tools.

182
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:50.430
Andrea Vona: mm hmm wait tools or grant like grants that we're trying to.

183
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.780
Andrea Vona: be awarded or or administer or tool.

184
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.670
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah you're after brands.

185
00:25:56.910 --> 00:26:02.250
Andrea Vona: That we work with so we work with, so the measure, a program and La county is a big one, for us, so that was.

186
00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:02.940
Andrea Vona: That was.

187
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:08.700
Andrea Vona: You know, passed by the voters in 2016 I think it was and.

188
00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:19.050
Andrea Vona: So that's huge because that has like a calculation built into it it's based off of the park needs assessment that like countywide park needs assessment and it has a.

189
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:31.740
Andrea Vona: Calculation in the formula is where geographic areas that are considered to be either high need are very high need for parks, which has several metrics built into that.

190
00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:48.270
Andrea Vona: received a more higher proportion of funding allocation so so it's directing more funding to those areas that are of the most need so that's a giant one for us, we found great value in the prop 68.

191
00:26:49.620 --> 00:27:01.560
Andrea Vona: proposition 68 through State through implemented through a lot of it through State parks, because the Community fact Finder tool that was developed by state parks prioritized.

192
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:16.110
Andrea Vona: You basically are going to rank higher through this competitive process if the lower than the median income and the less few less least amount of parks per one half mile radius.

193
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.090
Andrea Vona: For residents, so they developed a tool that's fantastic for that.

194
00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:30.300
Andrea Vona: So that's been valuable for our department to be able to win grant funds for very, very high need communities.

195
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.300
Andrea Vona: And pausing Clement did you have any other.

196
00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:43.590
Andrea Vona: Thinking I mean there's so me feel like so many grant programs now have.

197
00:27:44.070 --> 00:28:02.970
Andrea Vona: Your you have a more competitive edge if you're serving a disadvantage or severely disadvantaged Community or located in, so I think a lot of of them like urban greening has has ties in tie into that which is administered through natural route California department resources.

198
00:28:04.530 --> 00:28:10.410
Andrea Vona: cal fire I believe their programs tie in to definite stacks.

199
00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.670
Andrea Vona: For advantage, so I think there I think there's a.

200
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.380
Andrea Vona: And we seek funding from all of those programs.

201
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:31.530
Andrea Vona: And more somebody yeah and then we work with other other groups like national park and recreation Association, the nflpa and they have like I wouldn't say.

202
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:38.910
Andrea Vona: Well, they do have project funding but program funding for play equity and other you know equity measures that are focused on.

203
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:48.090
Andrea Vona: Serving serving communities so there's a whole and I guess, I will just comment that overall the La county.

204
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:56.310
Andrea Vona: Like department of parks and recreation, we hold up the park needs assessment as our North Star and so sort of all of our work is really focused.

205
00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:12.810
Andrea Vona: To try to bring as many resources as possible into high very high need areas as defined as we're kind of defining them through the park needs assessment and so that really that's how we prioritize our work and so.

206
00:29:14.250 --> 00:29:22.590
Andrea Vona: Because of that we're obviously looking for for any grant programs that we would have an advantage in applying toward that are going to have similar similar lines.

207
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:32.820
Kitty Craig (she/her): say I think I said this beginning but i'm up in Seattle and Washington up here and we in King county particular and.

208
00:29:33.390 --> 00:29:48.360
Kitty Craig (she/her): We are looking to La and to all the work the often done there to to really operationalize you know these promises of equitable funding projects so so much great work, some of which we've tried to copy.

209
00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:55.620
Kitty Craig (she/her): Working with Yvette about folks up to learn from you all were doing the work but you've just been incredible so.

210
00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:04.740
Kitty Craig (she/her): Anyway, I just wanted to kind of reiterate that you all are definitely on the cutting edge based on all these other places where we're working.

211
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:12.720
Andrea Vona: Oh that's so it well that's nice to hear because we're just kind of working and I don't know what's happening, but Clement is.

212
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:24.900
Andrea Vona: You know he's at the forefront of a lot of the work with the needs assessment and was involved in that process and in the development of that document, and I just want to also share.

213
00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:34.380
Andrea Vona: If I can plug you climate that he's in the process of developing right now over an update to our regional and world needs assessment.

214
00:30:34.710 --> 00:30:40.590
Andrea Vona: Because we found, and this is like a tangent sorry ariana from your end of this interview, but we found that.

215
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:53.100
Andrea Vona: While the park needs assessment it's so fantastic in so many ways there's some aspects of it that we realized that needed to be updated for rural and more regional parks and rural communities.

216
00:30:53.640 --> 00:31:03.210
Andrea Vona: Because there are true needs in a lot of these communities that don't always get captured by some of the metrics that are kind of prioritizing more urban places and so.

217
00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:20.070
Andrea Vona: we're looking at and and just candidly we found we were at a disadvantage that that tool I applauded earlier that part of that community fact Finder that California state parks develop also completely prioritize population density and.

218
00:31:21.210 --> 00:31:34.230
Andrea Vona: So we would have a committee we've we you know would have my like there'll be a community that had zero parks per acre per 1000 people, but because the maybe the the density was so low of people.

219
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:53.970
Andrea Vona: Anyway, i'm going down a little bit of a rabbit hole, but I just want to say that some of that might also apply kitty to what you're doing like less populous areas, possibly some of these updates of what clements looking out for trails and things like that, so you guys can connect.

220
00:31:54.720 --> 00:32:04.350
Kitty Craig (she/her): that'd be really learn more about, especially if you have stuff coming out That summarizes the work or tools or whatever and updates and reports and be great to track.

221
00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.980
Clement Lau | DPR: yeah kitty will have a report out this year.

222
00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:08.820
Kitty Craig (she/her): This year.

223
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.490
Clement Lau | DPR: is called a regional Andrew edition.

224
00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:20.790
Clement Lau | DPR: And we're calling is an update to the needs assessment as Andrew said that really focusing on.

225
00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:25.470
Clement Lau | DPR: Rural areas and the regional context.

226
00:32:26.610 --> 00:32:38.730
Clement Lau | DPR: You know, like, for example, I think, Andrew mentioned this for trail itself, we just look at our 2016 parks needs assessment is located within the study area that's I think low.

227
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:48.600
Clement Lau | DPR: Low need Stefan not high piney, but when you look it doesn't make a lot of sense when you're looking at a facility that serves a regional.

228
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:57.270
Clement Lau | DPR: Population so it's not just the immediate area that you're in also this broader what we're calling the visitor shared.

229
00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.340
Clement Lau | DPR: So.

230
00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.000
Clement Lau | DPR: So you see that kind of analysis in.

231
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:06.000
Clement Lau | DPR: This region on row edition that.

232
00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.320
Clement Lau | DPR: will be releasing and also just highlighting the needs of underserved rural areas.

233
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:34.800
Clement Lau | DPR: Which as Andrew said, have have no parks and they may be surrounded by parkland like National Park national forest, but in actuality they lack the amenities that maybe urban folks used to give it to this don't have.

234
00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:39.630
Clement Lau | DPR: playgrounds and sports courts and all that.

235
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:46.260
Clement Lau | DPR: So you don't want to deviate too much, but definitely have some things to share with you.

236
00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:55.950
Kitty Craig (she/her): so happy yeah it's not deviating at all I think it's super relevant and Aaron and I were just in a conversation yesterday with national park Service staff.

237
00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:05.970
Kitty Craig (she/her): you're kind of just getting coordinated on this project, but other things I mean there, and especially focusing on how can the federal government catch up with like.

238
00:34:06.690 --> 00:34:11.700
Kitty Craig (she/her): They probably will never catch up with like la county in terms of identifying.

239
00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:20.790
Kitty Craig (she/her): disadvantaged communities are priority communities, because there's obviously an administration commitment to directing resources to the communities that need it most, but.

240
00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:29.580
Kitty Craig (she/her): There is no standard and the agencies are trying to figure out a way, how can we create some.

241
00:34:30.210 --> 00:34:38.130
Kitty Craig (she/her): tools somewhat universal tools that can help make sure that we're directing resources to the places that need it most, and of course as a federal agency.

242
00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:50.850
Kitty Craig (she/her): may need to serve both rural and urban communities and that's often it seems like there are more formulas that do do what you're saying like I don't say it's figured out for urban areas, but.

243
00:34:51.930 --> 00:34:58.230
Kitty Craig (she/her): doesn't appear to be something that kind of crosses that rural urban area very well in terms of like one tool but.

244
00:34:58.590 --> 00:35:04.860
Kitty Craig (she/her): Anyway, so everything that you're sharing is really relevant to, and I think we'll end up highlighting this in the report, in some way.

245
00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:14.610
Kitty Craig (she/her): i'm in like understanding how everybody's measuring these things differently and trying to trying to draw some potential recommendations and connections to.

246
00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:30.060
Kitty Craig (she/her): You know, for the agency so they can help them kind of advance because they're really, really trying to figure out how to how to do better, and you know kind of create that institutional change to that needs to happen to.

247
00:35:31.830 --> 00:35:41.820
Kitty Craig (she/her): Make sure that they're delivering resources more equitably across all the communities that they serve so anyway learning a ton from what you all, are doing down in La.

248
00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:52.170
Andrea Vona: When they just updated kellen by room screen that's another tool, I know yeah 4% 4.0 now, which has got a lot of.

249
00:35:52.500 --> 00:36:04.290
Andrea Vona: But I think you're right can it'll be interesting to see if there would ever be one tool, or if it would be I kind of feel like it might be a menu like your project can qualify, and maybe there's a few tools like there's the.

250
00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:18.540
Andrea Vona: Whatever fact Finder or the viral screen or different if there's like I did see a grant recently where they allow you to pick one method to show how you were serving and disadvantage community.

251
00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:26.670
Andrea Vona: And they had four options and you'd have to choose one this was actually ironically from caltrans, which is our transportation.

252
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:33.510
Andrea Vona: I say, ironically, because they're kind of there was a little bit of a process, but I thought that was kind of interesting.

253
00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:41.490
Andrea Vona: And if you were tribal you were just automatically disadvantage, so it was like or maybe it was five options, though.

254
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:42.900
Andrea Vona: I could be something.

255
00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:45.300
Andrea Vona: to think about.

256
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:57.540
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah that's something we're talking about like how on ej screen, they have like national environmental data nothing on parks there's nothing on parts anywhere nationally.

257
00:36:58.020 --> 00:37:13.920
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): um so that is interesting, and I feel like an all the conversations we've had the urban requirement is just the 50,000 or more people is on it's it's not helping people like apply to these sort of grants.

258
00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:22.410
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): and also in terms of this is just fun i'm from La county and i'm from the antelope Valley, so when you guys were talking about rural communities like yeah.

259
00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:29.070
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): I was looking at your guys's report and seeing all the pictures of the poppy fields, and I was like Oh, I spent my whole life there.

260
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:30.900
Andrea Vona: Oh cool.

261
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:35.280
Andrea Vona: yeah we were trying to get a new park built in little rock.

262
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.790
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): My parents went to little rock high school and everything so.

263
00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:41.610
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): it's, like the other than like the unincorporated areas of a.

264
00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.690
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Little rock.

265
00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:57.600
Andrea Vona: Oh perfect your are her Africa yes and and that and, unfortunately, that project did not get funded through State parks and I I I I know it's because they told us it's because of the how the Community fact Finder.

266
00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:01.920
Andrea Vona: shook out and it's because the population density solo.

267
00:38:03.210 --> 00:38:17.670
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah and the whole antelope valley is just like a product of sprawl essentially so there's so many people that live there, but it's just spread out everywhere and it's so car dependent that like nothing as a 10 minute walking distance and the antelope valley from my experience.

268
00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.050
Andrea Vona: Exactly yeah you hit it on the head yeah that's right.

269
00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:30.900
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah i've done lots of reports and undergrad about transportation sprawl urban planning antelope valley yeah and i'll evaluate.

270
00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.330
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): It can use all the help I could get.

271
00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:50.910
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): um but yeah Thank you so much, and so our next question i'm on just in terms of going back to the hiking trail is what did you guys use for the other 50% of funding, what you guys use for the match, and when do you secure this funding.

272
00:38:51.600 --> 00:39:07.890
Andrea Vona: um we used a variety of sources, so we had you know we used, we had a grant already secured from the city of Los Angeles, we had local funds already secured from the puppy.

273
00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:19.860
Andrea Vona: proposition a there had there was one existing state park grant so it was it was a variety of sources that we were able to list.

274
00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.570
Andrea Vona: For the rest of the required funding sources.

275
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.210
Andrea Vona: On the budget table.

276
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:30.840
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): So they're all like from the city or from the State.

277
00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:32.430
Andrea Vona: They were.

278
00:39:33.690 --> 00:39:47.070
Andrea Vona: yeah they were state local state and local, I guess, so that one was city county I guess that would both be local and state so from from three yet, but no other federal funds.

279
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:49.560
Andrea Vona: Okay that's good to know.

280
00:39:50.340 --> 00:40:04.260
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And then another question is just when do you begin the cultural and environmental reviews um do you like start once you've been pre selected, or is the review process already begun before you i'm submitting to the state.

281
00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:06.390
Andrea Vona: My.

282
00:40:07.410 --> 00:40:14.040
Andrea Vona: recollection is that when we have we apply we apply, knowing that we would have to have.

283
00:40:14.910 --> 00:40:32.880
Andrea Vona: I think it's the section 106 and nepa done prior to a grant award, but we did not initiate any of that work until we were informed that our project was being recommended for funding, so I think that's correct right climate.

284
00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:35.730
Andrea Vona: Is that right yeah the story.

285
00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.170
Clement Lau | DPR: I would just add.

286
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:52.200
Clement Lau | DPR: You know, Andrew mentioned, as there was the fourth year of master plan so when that was done, there was a secret documents and then I remember the impact report that was done that contemplated included the trail.

287
00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:58.050
Clement Lau | DPR: So we satisfy sequel requirements, but with the Federal grant.

288
00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.250
Clement Lau | DPR: Now we have to do the federal.

289
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:05.490
compliance.

290
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:16.470
Kitty Craig (she/her): I realize, I was on mute and i'm typing away apologize, a question for that, because this is something that's come up in a few hundred conversations is.

291
00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:29.880
Kitty Craig (she/her): Is this cultural environmental review process, and I think Andrew you mentioned that those are kind of costs that this county would just kind of bear on its own, but I mean is there, how does it interact with.

292
00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:44.850
Kitty Craig (she/her): How do you fund those extra processes, I guess that's one question or could that be a barrier for some other jurisdictions applying for funding and then the second part is like How does that work with timing, because I know that.

293
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:52.350
Kitty Craig (she/her): Was processes can take a long time, and do you have to get those done before you even get to that final grant agreement.

294
00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:58.560
Kitty Craig (she/her): point of the process, I don't know do any more insight on giving us a little sense of that but.

295
00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:02.430
Andrea Vona: yeah I mean via I, my understanding is that we're supposed to have.

296
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:09.870
Andrea Vona: It done but by the time we they want to see that, in conjunction with like giving us a grant award.

297
00:42:10.530 --> 00:42:18.390
Andrea Vona: But I guess you're absolutely right it's like yes, that does take time and I suppose for some projects, there could be new.

298
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:35.520
Andrea Vona: I mean, this is just me talking like new mitigation measures that surface or new things to comply with that might surface for some projects, I think, because our project had an e ir already completed, we felt pretty strong competent around having.

299
00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:53.730
Andrea Vona: An an understanding of the project and impacts and knowing kind of where we would shake out for that, but I do believe that the added record the added added federal environmental regulations could be.

300
00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:03.270
Andrea Vona: The could I know they shouldn't be unanticipated because I do think that the program makes it very clear that applicants have to.

301
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:15.720
Andrea Vona: comply with federal environmental regulations, but I think I would yeah I could definitely would that cost time time to a project timeline if unless you unless your project already had federal funding.

302
00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.110
Andrea Vona: Until you already have that dealt with.

303
00:43:20.610 --> 00:43:27.540
Clement Lau | DPR: yeah I would just add to so section 106 it's pretty technical so we couldn't.

304
00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.560
Clement Lau | DPR: Do it in house, we have to hire a consultant.

305
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:43.170
Clement Lau | DPR: And Angela can correct me from wrong, we had to find money to pay for this, unfortunately, I think one of the other grants that we go for this project allows.

306
00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:45.540
Clement Lau | DPR: For this expenditure.

307
00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.700
Andrea Vona: Right right right.

308
00:43:51.150 --> 00:44:02.040
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And if you spend that money on a coal through review it still gets matched by NPs correct or because I know there's some issues i've heard with them.

309
00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:10.920
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): People like trying to work on the project prior to like the final grant agreement being breached and then NPs doesn't want to match that.

310
00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:15.570
Andrea Vona: yeah that's I think that's a that's a challenge, they.

311
00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:30.780
Andrea Vona: I forget the exact exact metrics but they only allow a certain amount or percentage I think of the matching funds to be expended in the planning phases and like within a certain time period before you have an executed grant agreement, so we had to get.

312
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:40.920
Andrea Vona: That down to the duck to the penny as well, like our as our match will be coming in at the same time, so, like you, you basically it like freezes the project until you.

313
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:56.640
Andrea Vona: can start working through their grant agreement again, so I don't know on matching I don't really I can't really speak to whether or not they match the environmental, but I just an overall for their their match.

314
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:10.770
Andrea Vona: yeah you can't have all the magic expended before I believe you cannot have all the magic spending, for example, and then have them come in and just have pay for the second half of the project, they want it kind of all concurrent.

315
00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:13.890
Andrea Vona: So.

316
00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:16.560
Andrea Vona: yeah.

317
00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:30.000
Andrea Vona: And it's our job to spend I mean you have to spend money on a project to get a project to the point where you know how much would it cost and what what is its exact design and and have enough information to apply for the grant.

318
00:45:31.080 --> 00:45:36.000
Andrea Vona: So you're you're presumably or down some sort of a road that has a timeline, so it is a challenge.

319
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.930
Kitty Craig (she/her): That was one question or one thing that we've heard this long timeline.

320
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:50.580
Kitty Craig (she/her): But it can be difficult to hold on to kind of match funding throughout that process is that was kind of one follow up question related.

321
00:45:50.850 --> 00:46:03.390
Kitty Craig (she/her): To kind of to match funding that we were that we had I don't know la has if you've experienced that or kind of any additional insight to share on that kind of just what it takes to maintain that when you wait.

322
00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:09.780
Andrea Vona: I think that's accurate statement because you know I think a lot oftentimes grants or let's say for three years, they want to give you a.

323
00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:15.570
Andrea Vona: grant for two to three years if it takes if you need to have your match all in place by the time you apply for orlev.

324
00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:27.780
Andrea Vona: you've applied by the time you apply in here back two years have gone and you're a firm two years have gone by, so you've got one year left on a grant it so yeah we were having to extend grants.

325
00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:39.270
Andrea Vona: But I would like to just also state that i'm not I cannot attribute that to or live like i'm not that's also.

326
00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:54.690
Andrea Vona: If we have a very complicated project with a complicated funding stretch, so I i'm not saying we are, we are extending grants because of war, look but i'm saying, but it is, I could see how one could have to do that because.

327
00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:13.680
Andrea Vona: it's just oftentimes state grants are from two to three years, like I said, and so you have to have them to apply, and then the next one takes two years to get you've got like a 12 month construction window, which can might be really tough.

328
00:47:14.850 --> 00:47:16.110
Andrea Vona: Depending on the project.

329
00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:30.120
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): All right, so I think we're coming up on time justin like if you guys have any last questions, I think we just have one final question that might be short.

330
00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:42.120
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And just if you had one ask for NPs or the state parks regarding or look funding and the program implementation, what would this ask me that we could bring back.

331
00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:45.930
Andrea Vona: Can I have a few as.

332
00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.250
Andrea Vona: Well, I would I would love it, I think it would be so helpful.

333
00:47:50.730 --> 00:48:03.360
Andrea Vona: Because it would be helpful, I think, for us to be really clear like application when the applications are due, when the awards would be announced when the contracts would be available to.

334
00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:13.980
Andrea Vona: recipients, because I think that would allow people to know if this grant program fits within the timeframe that they may have, or need to have for their project, and also because this.

335
00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:24.060
Andrea Vona: program funds land acquisition, these are certainties that people need to have when they're when they are dealing with a negotiating with potential land sellers so.

336
00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:40.050
Andrea Vona: It can't just be open and ambiguous so that would be requested one around more transparency and like adherence to timelines around awards and and contract executed implementation and then.

337
00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:53.790
Andrea Vona: yeah I mean it would be nice to just be it would be nice to be able to count fine, it would be nice to loosen up the brackets around the batch and not have it had to be so time bound like.

338
00:48:54.540 --> 00:49:06.300
Andrea Vona: If you know I get it if they didn't want to count funds that were spent 30 years ago on a project, but I mean something reasonable that's clearly for that project like I don't get the why it's bound the way it is.

339
00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:13.860
Andrea Vona: As a second comment, a third comment, the lw cf permanent map the map the jurisdiction.

340
00:49:15.210 --> 00:49:17.160
Andrea Vona: Are you familiar with that map requirement.

341
00:49:18.210 --> 00:49:20.160
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Or is it the in perpetuity.

342
00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.070
Andrea Vona: mm hmm mm hmm, so I think.

343
00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:27.900
Andrea Vona: Like.

344
00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.510
Andrea Vona: we're going back and forth with them a little bit on one of our on a map and it's.

345
00:49:35.160 --> 00:49:42.960
Andrea Vona: it'd, be it would be interesting to know if there could be other provisions for park agencies that are obviously in the business of.

346
00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:53.970
Andrea Vona: conserving places and operating places in perpetuity for public the restrictions around the old WCs map are are tight and so.

347
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:58.530
Andrea Vona: I don't know I could see that as being another potential barrier.

348
00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:18.630
Andrea Vona: Like we're working on a proper our project is has an operator land and so there's certain things we may not want to a fix in perpetuity on the space and so it's a and not want to have an candidly not don't feel we should have to negotiate those changes with MPs.

349
00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:22.650
Andrea Vona: When we in ourselves are.

350
00:50:24.270 --> 00:50:31.650
Andrea Vona: we're here to serve the public interest, so we so anyway, I think that could be looked at as well.

351
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:44.340
Kitty Craig (she/her): Can I ask a follow up on that were this from our Washington state liaison officers was around that like you know that the bounce edge they described it as like the boundaries.

352
00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:48.750
Kitty Craig (she/her): And so that's what you're talking about like when you have a project, you have to.

353
00:50:49.410 --> 00:51:04.920
Kitty Craig (she/her): draw those in permanent pen around whatever that project bb and then yeah you have those obligations to maintain it in perpetuity right and then any changes, you want to make to it that triggers that conversion process is that.

354
00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:25.140
Andrea Vona: Right correct, and so the added complication is and it's, not even the project boundary they want the boundary around the whole park or the whole parcel or land, so if you're if you're getting funds to improve a picnic shelter in a 30 acre park they want the boundary around 30 acre park.

355
00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:26.940
Kitty Craig (she/her): yeah.

356
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:34.560
Andrea Vona: And they fight for that, so I so that's kind of where we are we're like we just want to put in a trail, but now they want to encumber.

357
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:42.300
Andrea Vona: They want to uncover our 30 acres or whatever it is, but we have an operator it's a cultural arts performance venue before theater.

358
00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:50.040
Andrea Vona: it's an operator around and we're like that, and it has very aged aging facilities, and we know that we are going to need to like.

359
00:51:50.670 --> 00:52:03.900
Andrea Vona: Make the restrooms bigger we're going to have to modify the parking like there's things we know per the master plan that are already in the works, and so I weren't i'm just I don't want actually this to be attributed in any work.

360
00:52:04.050 --> 00:52:04.890
Kitty Craig (she/her): In detail, but.

361
00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:16.740
Andrea Vona: it's we're negotiate i'm trying to negotiate with them to like allow for flexible operations for an up you know it's still a recreation facility, but it's a cultural arts venue.

362
00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.200
Andrea Vona: So.

363
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:28.680
Andrea Vona: I get it like I used to actually be the end of a land trust and I totally love and support conservation easements and I worked in that space.

364
00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Andrea Vona: But so but they're like conservation easements but they're trying to put, but I feel like that's fine if you've got like a shady developer that's wanting to tap into funds, but if it's a park agency doing it, I just feel like they should there should maybe be a different way to work.

365
00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:47.370
Kitty Craig (she/her): yeah.

366
00:52:47.490 --> 00:52:49.290
Andrea Vona: That makes sense I just.

367
00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:56.640
Kitty Craig (she/her): You know, fully the Washington folks shared with us they're like yeah you know when it comes to trails we don't even recommend.

368
00:52:56.880 --> 00:53:16.020
Kitty Craig (she/her): This program like will scare applicants toward a different program because of that was what they were implying like, especially for a trail going through a site that might be quite large does that becomes onerous and the folks that we chatted with an Illinois she was saying that.

369
00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:25.200
Kitty Craig (she/her): Just the in perpetuity requirement and the conversion process just they don't even really use the program at all because of that for.

370
00:53:25.290 --> 00:53:26.730
Andrea Vona: yeah you can eat some.

371
00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:33.060
Kitty Craig (she/her): Noise, so this isn't really interesting thing to hear something that we might follow up with to get more detail on.

372
00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.160
Andrea Vona: yeah because I mean you know and.

373
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:44.100
Andrea Vona: yeah so it's difficult because I absolutely believe in the permanence of land protection, but if you've already got a space that's protected, because it's a park.

374
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:48.810
Andrea Vona: We have the park preservation act and calfresh like we already if we already have.

375
00:53:49.740 --> 00:54:04.110
Andrea Vona: protections in place or you know it's yeah it's interesting that additional layer of encumbrance I mean we're used to deed restrictions, because that's what state parks does actually require those as well, which are in perpetuity.

376
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:17.310
Andrea Vona: But it's not it's still not as I don't think there's still as onerous if there's a modifications at the park I don't think that that that causes a default on the deed restriction.

377
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:29.670
Andrea Vona: Whereas yeah if there's a structure that needs to be built, within a park that has the lw cf map recorded on it, then you have to consult with NPs and they're not fast.

378
00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:40.770
Andrea Vona: So I mean I don't like what is even that timeline look like like I don't know the end is someone going to remember that in 50 years.

379
00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.010
Kitty Craig (she/her): it's hard definitely not no color speak.

380
00:54:48.180 --> 00:54:49.440
Andrea Vona: yeah I mean.

381
00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:51.960
Andrea Vona: Oh, I don't know.

382
00:54:53.130 --> 00:55:09.030
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): um so I know we're like over time, I just want to ask, and if I missed anything if there's any follow up anyone has, at this moment, otherwise I can just send out the email with the information on attributing the report and any follow up questions we may have.

383
00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.440
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah, but I just want to say thank you so much for both for your time.

384
00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:19.020
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And for coming to talk to us and, hopefully, you know really informing this report to bring back to NPs.

385
00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:24.120
Clement Lau | DPR: Thank you.

386
00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.490
Kitty Craig (she/her): So this was great you are the first.

387
00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:37.950
Kitty Craig (she/her): city or county that we've chatted talk to you like real applicant kind of doing the work, so this has been really insightful and i'll help us we're going to meet with a few others as well, so this conversation kind of helps us.

388
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:46.590
Kitty Craig (she/her): understand some of those challenges right, you know, on the ground versus translated through a State Agency so so thank you.

389
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:54.780
Andrea Vona: I would assume that your results will would also be applicable to the lw cf program in.

390
00:55:54.780 --> 00:55:55.170
Andrea Vona: General.

391
00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:56.190
Andrea Vona: or no.

392
00:55:57.150 --> 00:56:12.090
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): I think a lot of the like like especially things are like written in law that will be applicable I think that's a big issue that people are having with or look and i'll WCs in perpetuity and just match the matching grant and things like that.

393
00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:19.260
Andrea Vona: yeah do you know i'm sorry I know we're over time, but what do you know why there's a matching requirement.

394
00:56:21.630 --> 00:56:24.300
Kitty Craig (she/her): it's in the founding legislation of all wc oh.

395
00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:32.340
Kitty Craig (she/her): It is yeah and that's always what we run up against with this issue is that all you gotta you gotta go to Congress to change it.

396
00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:47.250
Kitty Craig (she/her): So you need legislation to change it, and actually there's active legislation now that actually Senator pity is sponsoring to write in a match Weaver option for for this program in particular.

397
00:56:48.360 --> 00:57:05.010
Kitty Craig (she/her): That that led UCF doesn't have, and so I think, as you may recall, as you know, like, I think it could be something that should be in the long term reform of lw cf but you've got to open up that legislation to get at it and which can be.

398
00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:13.200
Andrea Vona: A little hard yeah I feel like we I we lobbied for I think it was like 15 years for the permanent.

399
00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:17.280
Andrea Vona: yeah I remember working on that, like 12 years ago.

400
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:18.330
Andrea Vona: yeah something.

401
00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:22.650
Andrea Vona: But I yeah maybe they can take the 25% of the.

402
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:27.330
Andrea Vona: unspent or look funds and like grantham someone to someone is matching the future years.

403
00:57:28.290 --> 00:57:34.020
Kitty Craig (she/her): yeah I know what was it like we need to think of a sliding scale or something.

404
00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:34.230
Andrea Vona: I.

405
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:43.620
Kitty Craig (she/her): can't be if you're asking if this if this program is meant for communities that need the you know need to meet these needs.

406
00:57:44.370 --> 00:57:53.280
Kitty Craig (she/her): We need to figure out how to meet them in the middle, or you know meet them all the way, but not asking them to you know put 50% of that funding up front and hold on.

407
00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:57.480
Kitty Craig (she/her): For years, while the Agency kind of figures out there, half the deal so.

408
00:57:58.740 --> 00:57:59.700
Kitty Craig (she/her): Those are theirs.

409
00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:10.650
Kitty Craig (she/her): And I there's a broad recognition, and I think that there's real opportunity to fix that specifically for this program but it doesn't help solve the larger the vcs yeah.

410
00:58:11.220 --> 00:58:13.530
Andrea Vona: But no, it would be, it makes sense to start with, or look.

411
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:15.060
Kitty Craig (she/her): yeah.

412
00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.560
Kitty Craig (she/her): Like get one little foot in the door.

413
00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:18.570
Kitty Craig (she/her): and see what happens.

414
00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:27.180
Kitty Craig (she/her): yeah now we're learning, so much so thank you you're helping us build out the story.

415
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:29.670
Kitty Craig (she/her): For sure.

416
00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:44.040
Kitty Craig (she/her): yeah and and I do have more time, I mean it's i've got a little more time, if you want to share anything else, but I want to respect respect your time as well, I mean you, all this is one very small aspect of your work.

417
00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.210
Thank you.

418
00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:51.660
Andrea Vona: Well i'm like I say yeah I was supposed to be at the I won't have to go to another meeting that i'm like.

419
00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:59.400
Andrea Vona: it's a giant meeting, so I think it won't be too, too, hopefully it conspicuously absent.

420
00:58:59.430 --> 00:59:00.690
Andrea Vona: But thank you all.

421
00:59:02.070 --> 00:59:02.580
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Thank you.

422
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:16.890
Kitty Craig (she/her): Okay well wonderful, but look for follow up and we may follow up with you on some additional clarifying coins, but also if you've got some other ideas that jump into your head don't hesitate to reach back out to us.

423
00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:23.100
Kitty Craig (she/her): Throughout this process we're just in this information gathering phase for another month or so so.

424
00:59:23.340 --> 00:59:29.790
Andrea Vona: Okay, great well when they reject her l WCs map again for the third time i'll evaluate.

425
00:59:30.990 --> 00:59:32.460
Kitty Craig (she/her): rejected for the third time.

426
00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:36.030
Andrea Vona: i'm kidding we've been going right it's just the going around and around and around with.

427
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:39.150
Clement Lau | DPR: Her timeline but there was.

428
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:40.740
Clement Lau | DPR: A good know it's like.

429
00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:42.060
Andrea Vona: yeah i'm being generous.

430
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:45.990
Kitty Craig (she/her): We have just makes you feel better but we've heard and.

431
00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:55.050
Kitty Craig (she/her): PS like wants an answer now, and and but they'll still take, like all day all as much time as they want to get back to you we've heard that.

432
00:59:56.310 --> 01:00:00.540
Kitty Craig (she/her): kind of have some challenges timely responses and communication.

433
01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:17.490
Andrea Vona: yeah I feel like that standard for funders like yeah you have to you have to comply, to their deadlines, but somehow funders don't need to really tell you when they're exactly going to know award or yeah I guess when you hold the purse.

434
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.020
Kitty Craig (she/her): Power yeah.

435
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:26.760
Kitty Craig (she/her): Okay well wonderful we learned so much, and thank you for your time thanks syriana.

436
01:00:27.150 --> 01:00:27.690
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Thank you.

Andrea Vona: Thanks bye bye.

438

Kitty Craig (she/her): Okay today.
