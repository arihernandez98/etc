1
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.230
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Okay, great so now we're ready to begin the interview so first if we could begin with introductions you already know kitty I did my little intro.

2
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:26.400
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And so, if you could please share your name preferred pronouns your professional role and place of employment, briefly, describing the work you do related to URL he and how long you've been at this position.

3
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:39.750
Heather Ahndan: Sure, my name is heather Ramsay on done I use she her pronouns i'm the land conservation initiative program manager for King county and i've been here just over two years my role is to coordinate our conservation.

4
00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:59.490
Heather Ahndan: strategy across six categories of land and also to make sure that we are distributing our services equitably doing catch up in areas that have been under invested and bringing culturally relevant access to the citizens of residents and visitors to King county.

5
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.070
Heather Ahndan: Before that I worked for national park service for 16 years administering well no water conservation fund.

6
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.480
Heather Ahndan: Including our LP until I left.

7
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:26.130
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah Thank you so much, and then we can jump into our first real question um so that we, we see that King county received an IRL P ground for the skyway park revitalization.

8
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.910
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Have you applied to other IRL P grams, and what is the county's overall experience applying to this program.

9
00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.830
Heather Ahndan: We do have another application pending for our took our.

10
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.690
Heather Ahndan: shoot them forgot, what we are calling it the lakeland north.

11
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.520
Heather Ahndan: Urban forest, I think, is what the grant project is and that we're waiting on scoring so that was last grant round.

12
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.060
Heather Ahndan: Experience with.

13
00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:05.340
Heather Ahndan: The I wasn't with King county when we applied for skyway I actually was on the other side of the table and did the skyway grant from the park service side.

14
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:17.010
Heather Ahndan: And I mean, from my perspective, then it was smooth I don't know what my colleagues would say, I think that project has run into challenges with an anticipated permitting requirements or additional wetland complications.

15
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.500
Heather Ahndan: So.

16
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:29.250
Heather Ahndan: yeah I would have to find out more about the status, but the the project that we just worked on to apply for I would say.

17
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.450
Heather Ahndan: I mean, like all our CEO grants and park service grants it's it's a lot of work to do it.

18
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:45.930
Heather Ahndan: The system that that Washington uses, I think, is is pretty good in terms of accessibility, the biggest challenge for us is lead time it's it's.

19
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.880
Heather Ahndan: it's really hard to get our match sources to line up with the timelines for the grants.

20
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.230
Heather Ahndan: yeah Thank you.

21
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:09.390
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And then, in your experience with or LP what components, do you think are working particularly well and why do you think any of these are all the components are working well.

22
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.950
Heather Ahndan: um.

23
00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.020
Heather Ahndan: I think if you know how to find it there's really good information in the grant package.

24
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.530
Heather Ahndan: That park service puts out about.

25
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.930
Heather Ahndan: What applications should include i'm not sure.

26
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:38.970
Heather Ahndan: One that most applicants know to go straight to grants.gov and get that I think most of them are accessing the program through a State portal that's been.

27
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.490
Heather Ahndan: You know they try to take that and make it more accessible, because it's really dense but sometimes things get lost in the translation.

28
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:57.150
Heather Ahndan: So if you know, to go to that there's good information there it, it is really dense it can be hard to parse out what exactly it is.

29
00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:12.300
Heather Ahndan: That is being requested, if you don't already know, I found it hard and I figured like most applicants I probably at least have a solid, you know, a pretty solid understanding of how it's supposed to work.

30
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.990
Heather Ahndan: And it, it still was pretty challenging the Informations there it's just it's dense.

31
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.700
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah and our next question is about.

32
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.960
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): What other challenges, you have encountered with the program besides the like dense application um yeah.

33
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.120
Heather Ahndan: I mean again back to lead time, so, in addition to the the match being.

34
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.150
Heather Ahndan: A challenge you know holding on to our match.

35
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:46.740
Heather Ahndan: And I I don't think that problem is unique to Washington state, I think a lot of.

36
00:04:48.270 --> 00:05:00.000
Heather Ahndan: The country is experiencing a lot of pressures around acquisition at that interface between rural and urban where you would want to do a lot of these new park spaces, because.

37
00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:15.150
Heather Ahndan: Of the sort of the zoom boom and as as people who are in cities move out those properties are going for fast and a lot above market value, and so you have to be pretty nimble so not having flexibility.

38
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.690
Heather Ahndan: Around timelines on when you can purchase in relation to the grant round can be really hard and.

39
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.970
Heather Ahndan: That long lead time can also make Community engagement really challenging because you lose momentum so you have to make a choice between.

40
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:41.280
Heather Ahndan: waiting to start like your your in depth Community engagement, you know doing preliminary Community engagement and then pausing.

41
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:56.760
Heather Ahndan: And then doing you're really end up after you've got the grant which means your grant maybe it's not as competitive or doing it early and having a more competitive grant application and then having a really long lead time to delivery, which then sacrifices your.

42
00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.370
Heather Ahndan: reputation is not the right word but.

43
00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.920
Heather Ahndan: it's it's hard for Community to to understand that even communicating it looks like you're not delivering on your promises.

44
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:24.900
Heather Ahndan: And so that's a that's a challenging balance for project proponents is making a choice between competitiveness and and Community relationship and I guess we'll find out, we we you know.

45
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:34.260
Heather Ahndan: built some Community relationship work into our planning process as part of the grant I don't know if that will be competitive, but that's that's one thing I guess I would flag.

46
00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.620
Heather Ahndan: Potentially if you're going to do really robust.

47
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.990
Heather Ahndan: Really deeply engaged Community work.

48
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.880
Heather Ahndan: that's authentic.

49
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.470
Heather Ahndan: I think you need to be in a place where you know that you're going to be able to deliver the project.

50
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:50.880
Heather Ahndan: right then it's just kind.

51
00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:52.320
Kitty Craig: of broken promises right.

52
00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:02.910
Kitty Craig: And I guess either, would you say that this is unique to the acquisition projects that are proposed versus the because now that I think about it, some of the.

53
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:05.580
Kitty Craig: Like with Seattle and.

54
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:13.980
Kitty Craig: la like you know it was just restoration projects or development projects that they might have had some master plans already prepared for.

55
00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:32.190
Heather Ahndan: Maybe i'm maybe it's unique to those parks that are brand new either acquisition, or like really a fundamental renovation, I think it probably has more to do with funding access meaning I think some of those bigger municipalities, the seattle's and or or not bigger but.

56
00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:43.650
Heather Ahndan: agencies that have a Development Fund available for parks, maybe have more flexibility, meaning that they can afford to do some of that preliminary work.

57
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.870
Heather Ahndan: Knowing that if they don't get this grant they'll pull money from some other project or.

58
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:50.640
Heather Ahndan: or they can.

59
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:58.560
Heather Ahndan: I don't know they have other options to slice and dice we really don't have development grant funding available like we have.

60
00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:10.800
Heather Ahndan: A little bit, but not at the scale that we need to really program these spaces are funding is almost entirely acquisition and so it's really important for us to be able to leverage acquisition against development so that does bring some additional.

61
00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:12.810
Heather Ahndan: complications, but I wouldn't say.

62
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.990
Heather Ahndan: Just I think for anybody your match source if you're.

63
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:29.580
Heather Ahndan: If it's the it's partly the unpredictability to like you know in our CEO grant is going to take two to three years between application and delivery and you can plan for that on a development grant or an acquisition grant either way.

64
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:37.380
Heather Ahndan: But with overlap, one of the additional challenges, I think, is that you can't be guaranteed win the grand rounds going to run.

65
00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:45.390
Heather Ahndan: And when the final decisions, going to be made and that's a big difference between regular lw cf and overlap is.

66
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:59.460
Heather Ahndan: You know, maybe it's going to be another year, maybe it's going to be two more years, maybe it's going to be six months it's just it's really hard to know and so it's hard to make promises to Community and then keep coming back and say oh i'm sorry, they still haven't run the grant round.

67
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:11.400
Heather Ahndan: And I don't mean to sound critical park service, I know it's been really challenging to deliver the program they're working on it and staffing and capacity and all that stuff but.

68
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:20.190
Heather Ahndan: But it's that's I think the piece that's harder rather than it being acquisition or development or or your your funding at the local level.

69
00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:33.930
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah that's something we definitely heard from like la and Seattle just that, though, or look grant wasn't much of a challenge for them, as it wasn't going to make or break the project regardless, they were going to find funds.

70
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:43.470
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And so, our next question is, on average, around 25% of or look funding is not utilize each grant cycle.

71
00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:54.240
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And so, why do you think that cities and urban areas are not applying for this funding, and I think you kind of got into that with just the unpredictable timeline and delivering a promise, but if there's anything else.

72
00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.660
Heather Ahndan: I think that's a piece of it, I think matches a real barrier.

73
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.230
Heather Ahndan: Particularly in these areas that don't.

74
00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:17.010
Heather Ahndan: You know, they need to be oftentimes they're large scale projects they're pretty expensive, the reason why they're not developed sometimes those complexities on site, you know hazardous waste or there's Gray scape stuff that needs to be permitting is more challenging.

75
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:19.860
Heather Ahndan: So.

76
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:24.420
Heather Ahndan: I think it's really hard to come up with.

77
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:33.090
Heather Ahndan: 50% because it's the can't really fill in but you know you're in kinds not going to get you up the way would for $250,000 project.

78
00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:51.360
Heather Ahndan: that's a piece of it, I would question whether the problem is that people aren't applying like the funding going, or is it the people who are applying aren't getting funded, I would ask park service, how many of the applications they've received they decide we're not qualified.

79
00:10:53.010 --> 00:11:02.400
Heather Ahndan: I think that's really a big piece and and I don't think that the Federal Government as a whole has yet shifted to you know a few years ago, I was, I was in on the conversation with.

80
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:07.440
Heather Ahndan: philanthropy and it was sort of the executive leadership at the federal level and many.

81
00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:11.280
Heather Ahndan: People in the world of philanthropy have shifted to.

82
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:18.570
Heather Ahndan: merit based scoring right, you know they're looking at the project as a whole and they're not.

83
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:34.980
Heather Ahndan: Just qualifying projects on technical things they figure will score the wolf and the project and will help them get through the technical piece I don't think the federal agencies are there yet, I get the sense that projects are being disqualified for technicalities when.

84
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.400
Heather Ahndan: You know, maybe it's a capacity issue on park service, maybe it's philosophical i'm not sure what but.

85
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:49.920
Heather Ahndan: Could they say we this project has merit and we're going to help you get the application to the point where it can be funded.

86
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:56.580
Heather Ahndan: Instead of just disqualifying it and saying come back next year, especially since there's no follow up to say why did it gets qualified.

87
00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:07.500
Heather Ahndan: And people can ask, but the answers I don't know they're not they're often not concrete enough to be really actionable, I think, or at least that's the feedback, I heard when I was on the flip side from.

88
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:23.760
Heather Ahndan: Applicants we in King county haven't done enough to know, I think, yet how that technical assistance, maybe has improved in the last few years, I don't know, but my sense is that a lot of projects are getting kicked out the door without getting scored because of.

89
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:27.300
Heather Ahndan: You know, things that could be easily corrected.

90
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:33.060
Kitty Craig: yeah I think we have certainly heard that.

91
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:42.360
Kitty Craig: which gets into some issues around communication and transparency and decision making and.

92
00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:56.190
Kitty Craig: And then inconsistent communication from the park service anyway, just a lot of kind of a bit of a black box sort of issue with once things leave state hands.

93
00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:00.060
Kitty Craig: And, and then the lack of.

94
00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:13.230
Kitty Craig: yeah yeah just seemingly not having kind of clear guidance on what what really would qualify and be strong and then on the flip side you think you've got a great project.

95
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.580
Kitty Craig: gets denied or doesn't make it through that process.

96
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:33.090
Heather Ahndan: he's an even a staff, I felt that, like I would work really hard with applicants to put together packages staff and then it would get disqualified by DC and never really would understand, and I hope that you're not going to go back to park service and be like heather said.

97
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:41.640
Heather Ahndan: But I i'll just reiterate an ECHO, yes, and not knowing who's on the grant panel either like.

98
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:43.410
Heather Ahndan: You know.

99
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:53.370
Heather Ahndan: Particularly when you're framing is around equity I think it's really important that your panel first is trained up and.

100
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.730
Heather Ahndan: You know their their bias.

101
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.350
Heather Ahndan: And you know.

102
00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:05.310
Heather Ahndan: equity and social justice issues and I don't I would be shocked if that was happening.

103
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:16.830
Heather Ahndan: But I don't know who those people are like I have no idea who's on the panels, so I also think geographical distribution is really important, I don't know that that's happening either.

104
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:18.840
Kitty Craig: On the panel.

105
00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:19.650
Heather Ahndan: on animal.

106
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:29.430
Kitty Craig: Can you can you provide us with any more insight into that into that I don't I don't know how it's changed, maybe, since you left but that's one thing that area now we're like what happens once it.

107
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.450
Kitty Craig: gets over there and who be on staff is.

108
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:38.460
Heather Ahndan: They select a panel of people to review it, I have no idea who those people are.

109
00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:49.920
Heather Ahndan: I kind of got the impression that it was a combination of DC staff in park service, as well as maybe interior and or some political appointees.

110
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:58.890
Heather Ahndan: And maybe some industry, you know, like you know, maybe it was the policy person from nr PA or maybe it was the state parks association director.

111
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:08.160
Heather Ahndan: Those sort of level of executive level folks but I don't know I i'm totally guessing it was never it was never shared it was always treated as confidential.

112
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:08.970
Oh.

113
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.590
Kitty Craig: yeah.

114
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:22.590
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah Thank you and I definitely love the reframing of the question of like instead of why do you think cities and urban areas are not applying for funding, why not.

115
00:15:22.950 --> 00:15:30.660
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Like you know we know people are applying why aren't they getting that funding instead that's really great like a different way to think about it.

116
00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:43.170
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): i'm sorry, the question is, are does the current design of our LP help ensure funds are being directed to communities that are most in need of additional funding for more or improved outdoor recreation.

117
00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.670
Heather Ahndan: Maybe.

118
00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:10.950
Heather Ahndan: I think it prioritises projects that are big and splashy and transformational and so that predisposes the funding to those agencies that are already fairly well resourced meaning like you have to be pretty.

119
00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:18.690
Heather Ahndan: Like Seattle has been very competitive and, and rightly so, they, I think, have done a lot of work in the equity arena.

120
00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:33.270
Heather Ahndan: There they've got a lot of funding from partners set up already that helps them be competitive, and they are able to compete these big scale projects that are really needed, and for the communities that get funded for South Park, for you know.

121
00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:36.540
Heather Ahndan: I don't know where there are other projects are but.

122
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:41.190
Heather Ahndan: Those are really important projects skyway you know for us.

123
00:16:41.910 --> 00:16:53.640
Heather Ahndan: I worry about the smaller scale need is as great communities, not as well resourced projects and we've been thinking about that a lot and Kenny, even in some of those conversations with Emerald alliance.

124
00:16:54.480 --> 00:17:12.030
Heather Ahndan: As an agency that is that has staff has capacity that has to match resources it's it's hard for us to apply, how can we lift up the the see tax and the, you know as a quad not as quad Syrians and those communities that are.

125
00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:24.450
Heather Ahndan: You know don't it's like the park service director is also the grant writer is also their maintenance staff person and they're having a hard time coming up with match, but the need and the Community is really great.

126
00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:32.340
Heather Ahndan: If you talk to the Community based organization, so that it feels like a gap to me and that feels like there needs to be more.

127
00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:39.450
Heather Ahndan: I don't know, maybe there's opportunities to do more with joint applications, or something or.

128
00:17:40.650 --> 00:17:54.750
Heather Ahndan: Maybe there's a special category for municipalities that have budgets smaller than some threshold, but population greater than some threshold and they don't have to compete against you know there's tiered applications, or something.

129
00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.750
Heather Ahndan: To help level the playing field a little bit.

130
00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.390
Kitty Craig: On that so.

131
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:05.610
Kitty Craig: toward the end of our.

132
00:18:05.850 --> 00:18:06.720
Kitty Craig: interview I had some.

133
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:12.780
Kitty Craig: Maybe some more detailed like questions that we haven't asked other folks out there just because your expertise, but this kind of starts to touch on one where.

134
00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:29.310
Kitty Craig: This concept of like a special category for a city with a certain capacity, would you say that that is like within the discretion of the agency to deal with like administratively or is that something that they would say Oh, we we can't do that.

135
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:34.890
Heather Ahndan: You know well, since it hasn't been codified yet right.

136
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.120
Kitty Craig: Yes, a program.

137
00:18:36.330 --> 00:18:41.490
Heather Ahndan: there's a line item in there, it feels like the Agency has a lot of administrative discretion at this point.

138
00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.150
and

139
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:52.230
Heather Ahndan: Maybe they're getting direction from the administration I don't know or Congress, or like maybe their budget notes that are spelling out some of the stuff that I don't know.

140
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:59.460
Heather Ahndan: But for now let's just an appropriation item, it seems like there's flexibility eventually.

141
00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.040
Kitty Craig: Let me come back to that.

142
00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:23.580
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Thank you, and then our next question is looking at like the definitions of underserved that come out in the notice of funding opportunities and how those have been a little inconsistent or have changed throughout the cycles.

143
00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:39.060
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): So orla is intended to direct funding to underserved and economically disadvantaged communities, but we know these terms are inconsistent and so, how does King county define underserved populations regarding park equity.

144
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:51.510
Heather Ahndan: I think one thing to flag, if you don't maybe you already know this, but the reason that those are inconsistent is because the administration gets to define them as they come in so each administration defines what counts is underserved differently.

145
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:57.300
Heather Ahndan: And I think that, in part, is OK, because executive branches are meant to.

146
00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:05.370
Heather Ahndan: move with administrative priorities as long as it's transparent I think it's going to be hard to come up with a one.

147
00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:12.060
Heather Ahndan: Definition fits all approach and so some of the strength is.

148
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:17.880
Heather Ahndan: If they can keep it high level and then let us define for ourselves what counts, but for King county.

149
00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:37.800
Heather Ahndan: What we did was went through a very intentional multi year process with Community based organizations to define that, and so our our first cut of underserved is at the intersection of poor health outcomes and we have a metric that we've created that.

150
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:49.170
Heather Ahndan: As an index of several you know asthma hospitalization rates and some of that kind of stuff and I can get you those data, if you want the specifics and.

151
00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:59.040
Heather Ahndan: Poverty people living in poverty and lack of open space and we've used the trust Republic lands work on open space that 10 mile walk quarter mile.

152
00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:00.990
Heather Ahndan: In URBAN.

153
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:12.780
Heather Ahndan: mile and rural two miles and so we've mapped those out and then recognizing again back to this not it doesn't fit everybody piece that's.

154
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:20.070
Heather Ahndan: Important we have a discretionary process and we provide criteria.

155
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:26.100
Heather Ahndan: That includes things like you know percent children under five and percent.

156
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:37.650
Heather Ahndan: You know, different for foreign origin or English language learning percentages or school or school reduced lunch population some of that kind of metrics.

157
00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:50.910
Heather Ahndan: And what people craft a story my experience with or lab is that the intent to do that is there, but who's making that decision i'm not sure that they're.

158
00:21:52.410 --> 00:21:55.440
Heather Ahndan: Like they're looking to get to it feels like they lead with no.

159
00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:56.820
Kitty Craig: yeah.

160
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.160
Heather Ahndan: It feels like they lead with no and it's.

161
00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:05.250
Heather Ahndan: A pretty high bar to get to yes, and I would say, for us, for our committee it's the flip side it's.

162
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:12.690
Heather Ahndan: You know we're careful because we don't want it to be like a fake equity project right you want to guard against that, but I think we lead from.

163
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:22.530
Heather Ahndan: A value that applicants are trying to do the right thing and that they're trying to serve the right populations, and we want to help them get there.

164
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.040
Heather Ahndan: And so, our projects will fund projects.

165
00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:37.440
Heather Ahndan: That can demonstrate that they serve those populations, even if they're not like in that same geography, for example.

166
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:49.080
Heather Ahndan: Or you know, yes, they have park access but it's it's not very it's not big enough and will fund prod we won't just disqualify it because they don't meet that proximity metric will let them say to us.

167
00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:58.980
Heather Ahndan: You know, yes, they have a park but it's only an acre and it's a really steep ravine, and this would give us a chance to put on a playground, or whatever the story is there's that opportunity and i'm not I don't know if that's is.

168
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.800
Heather Ahndan: If or Lopez is versatile.

169
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:05.820
Heather Ahndan: And in practice.

170
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:07.920
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah.

171
00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.540
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): I definitely feel like that's something we've.

172
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:17.370
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): heard from other states and just that they feel like they know what's the best for their communities and like a lot of their applicants like feel like you know.

173
00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:26.250
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): they're doing the right thing they're creating a project that will serve a hardcore community, but then it gets denied funding because X y&z.

174
00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:32.850
Heather Ahndan: yeah and then you question like well but who are you are you sitting in DC Do you really know what this is like like.

175
00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:43.980
Heather Ahndan: I don't like race metrics, for example, I think it's one of the things it's pretty challenging we found when we map that we got a lot of hits in very wealthy.

176
00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:56.430
Heather Ahndan: High park portions because those are our demographics right, we have a lot of folks coming from other countries to take advantage of tech jobs, you know well educated well compensated fairly smart.

177
00:23:57.210 --> 00:24:04.740
Heather Ahndan: But you know English isn't the first language spoken in their home they've got you know children under five or whatever some of those other metrics and they meet some of the race demographics, but.

178
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:10.560
Heather Ahndan: But we know that that's not and you can rather than a grant application and say this is so that's why we're not funding.

179
00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:20.760
Heather Ahndan: Here we're funding here, but I don't know if it's compelling if you're not on the ground, or maybe you don't know that you need to parse that out, because the person scoring it's never been to.

180
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.810
Heather Ahndan: You know west of the Mississippi.

181
00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.420
Heather Ahndan: Or, and I think back to sort of what's in the codification language to, I think.

182
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:36.540
Heather Ahndan: Particularly for tribal those some of the population, demographics, is really.

183
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:45.480
Heather Ahndan: cutting them out just because of the past historic patterns of the way reservations have been set up, but, like all of that stuff with land use.

184
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:53.220
Heather Ahndan: So, are you really reaching the people that have the most need, I think people would argue that regular LGBT the African.

185
00:24:53.640 --> 00:25:07.830
Heather Ahndan: can hit that but in many states, the ceiling on regular elder bcf and their their apportionment like how much they get makes these kinds of big transformational projects not possible, except for in the National Fund so the only place for them to go for something.

186
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.160
Heather Ahndan: large scale would be this and if they.

187
00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:18.300
Heather Ahndan: For population reasons can't hit you know because they're trying to serve a more rural area.

188
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:34.920
Heather Ahndan: That can be problematic it feels like that could be a special category also back to these sort of tiered categories, you know, maybe, maybe there's a part of funding specific for rural like large transformational projects or something I don't know.

189
00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:40.260
Heather Ahndan: Time sponsored projects Alaska natives whatever that might be quiet natives.

190
00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:43.560
Heather Ahndan: yeah we've definitely.

191
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:55.320
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): I know we talked a lot at the beginning about the tribal aspect of or LP and how it says that, like you know private communities can apply, but how many ever applied, let alone been funded.

192
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.670
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): I think, new Mexico is doing work around this that i'm not sure.

193
00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:00.900
Heather Ahndan: i'll see the.

194
00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:09.630
Heather Ahndan: The the data question to ask us how many would be eligible right like how many tribes have populations that meet the population threshold.

195
00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:15.810
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah and the Federal recognition aspects i'm.

196
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:28.020
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Sorry, our next question is, how does King county currently define or calculate a poverty level or economically disadvantaged areas in terms of UCF and look funding.

197
00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:29.820
yeah.

198
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.880
Heather Ahndan: We we've been relying on that.

199
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.170
Heather Ahndan: work that we had done so those those areas are called opportunity areas, and we do.

200
00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:56.820
Heather Ahndan: Poverty is embedded in one of those in are the three metrics that we use to create our priority areas and I need to go back I should know this, but it's it's I think we use like three times the federal poverty rate or something that's relevant to us because.

201
00:26:57.930 --> 00:27:03.600
Heather Ahndan: Because the high cost of living in King county as compared with the rest of most of the country.

202
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:06.240
Heather Ahndan: Just using federal poverty rates would.

203
00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:14.160
Heather Ahndan: not be enough so we've we've done some data work there, I don't i'm sorry I should know that off the top of my head, but I don't.

204
00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.330
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Know that's no problem I know.

205
00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:22.560
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): i've done like some work and, like the bay area and they face the.

206
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.640
Heather Ahndan: same thing yeah.

207
00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:33.750
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): issue that there's so many disadvantaged communities Bay area, the cost of living is so expensive and it's completed by all the high incomes around the area, the same process.

208
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:41.730
Heather Ahndan: I made a note to follow up with data for you it's all in js too, so you can look at exactly what our data sources are from and.

209
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:52.710
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah yeah that'll be great and go to even just as like a reference to what other people are doing, perhaps best practices sort of situation.

210
00:27:53.700 --> 00:28:06.450
Heather Ahndan: yeah I know that was I worked with gpo when they updated their park score this Round and the many of the panelists had flag that as an issue also so even in communities that aren't New York or Seattle or San Francisco it's still.

211
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:15.420
Heather Ahndan: A lot of the country, particularly the urban parts of the country that this programs in debt are experiencing this to some degree right so.

212
00:28:16.770 --> 00:28:17.940
Heather Ahndan: yeah having an indexed.

213
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.160
Heather Ahndan: poverty rate is important.

214
00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:37.260
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And our next question is on or off the applications require a quantification of job development or job creation, how has your agency handled these sort of calculations or if you know, on the flipside from MPs as well.

215
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:47.580
Heather Ahndan: Neither that's kind of knew I actually since I left NPs I don't think we were doing that quantification before, because we were using different administration metrics when I left.

216
00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:57.240
Heather Ahndan: That was that was really hard for us to quantify because we're doing it, but we don't like we don't count it necessarily separately.

217
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:03.810
Heather Ahndan: So I i'm not sure we.

218
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:09.210
Heather Ahndan: will have to see when our application came back if that if the way we handled it was.

219
00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:11.790
Heather Ahndan: yeah.

220
00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:19.050
Heather Ahndan: Like we have a new, a lot of new programs, we had just created, but we don't have the data yet if that makes sense, so we talked about that.

221
00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.630
Heather Ahndan: But I don't know that I could put like $1 figure to it yet.

222
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:36.840
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah, the question is definitely it seems like it is quite confusing on how to quantify job development or job creation or even what NPs wants to see.

223
00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:50.100
Heather Ahndan: And what counts like are you talking about like you know I could look at okay what's the construction contract going to be, and we could get data that way, like our economic development, but.

224
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:57.300
Heather Ahndan: it's harder to quantify things like we have a program in place to prioritize.

225
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:03.750
Heather Ahndan: Temporary funding from the zip code that's being served by the project right so.

226
00:30:05.130 --> 00:30:10.440
Heather Ahndan: But that's so new that I don't know if we we don't have the data, yet we have a new Program.

227
00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.040
Heather Ahndan: Where we hire we work with.

228
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:25.530
Heather Ahndan: folks who are living on sheltered, for example, and train them and job skills in parks maintenance administration and then go forward and help with job placement like they would.

229
00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:31.380
Heather Ahndan: Work on a project like this, but I don't know you know and whole bunch of others like do I.

230
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:43.140
Heather Ahndan: Take like Point two F T or I don't you know I don't know that we have we'd have to figure that out, so it would be helpful to know how we want that counted, so that we could start counting it the right way.

231
00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:45.600
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah definitely I think.

232
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:59.640
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): One of the recommendations we may make is like MPs, or if there's some sort of calculator for these sort of things that people can plug numbers into because right now it's like everyone is doing whatever like it's a different answer each time.

233
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:05.280
Heather Ahndan: yeah and it makes it hard to compare us the grant reviewer right um yeah.

234
00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:08.700
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): i'm.

235
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:26.430
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Sorry next question is what has your experience working with Washington our co authors and and PS can like do they provide application assistance communicate effectively and timely or any recommendations may have for our CEO and he is in this process.

236
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:29.850
Heather Ahndan: i'm.

237
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:40.200
Heather Ahndan: I think our experience communicating with NPs and getting timely answers out of NPs.

238
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:44.280
Heather Ahndan: it's hard to say because.

239
00:31:51.510 --> 00:32:01.320
Heather Ahndan: I think the staff person is pretty new and getting response from the staff level it's been hard and we've only really tried around waivers I think.

240
00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:17.880
Heather Ahndan: You know, like when we needed one I just texted DC so i'm not sure i'm like a really good like hey are you still doing this and what do we need kind of I don't i'm not sure that that's what is the experience for i'm not sure I would say i'm an outlier Maybe you can toss that.

241
00:32:19.710 --> 00:32:30.630
Heather Ahndan: So I think this is pretty responsive but it's the staff or it's still pretty overwhelmed it's hard to get I think our CEO has a hard time getting answers out of NPs.

242
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:33.210
Heather Ahndan: Our CEO.

243
00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:46.920
Heather Ahndan: same thing, I mean they're pretty overcapacity to like they're great about providing some technical assistance, but they have a lot on our plates, and so I don't know that they can provide the kind of hand holding.

244
00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:58.290
Heather Ahndan: That some applicants really need to get through this process so back to this idea that katie and I have been bouncing around about do we do some kind of targeted workshop they don't want to step on our CEOs toes.

245
00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:06.030
Heather Ahndan: At the same time, I think they're feeling like each person's got hundreds and hundreds of applications that they're between all their grants and their grand rounds and so.

246
00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:16.440
Heather Ahndan: I don't know that they really have the capacity to provide the technical assistance that they really need so i'm sorry back to your original question I just ranted and lost track of it.

247
00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:27.990
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): No, no, I totally yeah you answered the question just on, you know how what's your experience been like working with them our CEO and NPs and.

248
00:33:29.070 --> 00:33:29.340
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah.

249
00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:45.300
Heather Ahndan: yeah I think it's hard for our CEO for this program in particular because back to the transparency it's hard to know what makes a good project and what they're looking for, unlike regular other bcf where the states have so much more discretion so they're much better source of assistance.

250
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:59.670
Heather Ahndan: And on the staff side, sometimes it felt like we were making it up as we went along you know, like we didn't know either the administration would say, like our priorities this but they had to figure out what what does that really mean and what do we mean by that and.

251
00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:10.380
Heather Ahndan: And at the same time, you know you're trying to field 40 grant applications and get them all under contract in two weeks, and so it's just.

252
00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.150
Heather Ahndan: I don't think people are intentionally trying to not be transparent, I think more capacity and not really having a chance to.

253
00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:23.250
Heather Ahndan: And then, by the time you get an answer it's changes because there's a new administration.

254
00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.170
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah something we heard from NPs that like.

255
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:36.570
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): They want to do these things, but they don't know how to define it they don't know how to map it they don't have the resources to do these things, and they don't want to do it wrong.

256
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:41.910
Heather Ahndan: yeah and I think that there's a lot of fear.

257
00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:54.630
Heather Ahndan: They don't want to do it wrong, and so they don't do anything and and I think that's back to the how many applications aren't getting funded it's that it's that they don't.

258
00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:11.460
Heather Ahndan: They don't want to be called on the carpet by Congress, or by personally, and this is my senate as having been in the government you're going to get called on the carpet, no matter what you do so, you may as well be doing it in the favor of helping partners that's my personal philosophy.

259
00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:22.230
Heather Ahndan: But you know they're also getting audited constantly and so there's all that sort of background that's that makes it hard to just be nimble and move things.

260
00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:32.910
Heather Ahndan: Maybe it would help if Congress provided some of that guidance, but even still the convocation stuff it's still pretty high level like that's the way laws are, and then the administration.

261
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:42.030
Heather Ahndan: You know you interpret it, but I think it's hard for park service and the last administration to not to get political, but there is a lot of turnover in leadership.

262
00:35:43.110 --> 00:35:44.910
Heather Ahndan: At park service, as well as interior.

263
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:53.850
Heather Ahndan: As well as sort of executive staff, and so it was like constantly redo every six months i'd have to re catch somebody up and so.

264
00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:56.820
Heather Ahndan: I think that's my heart to.

265
00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:05.490
Kitty Craig: One one comment that we got this is specific we haven't heard this in any other interview, but from our CEO.

266
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:08.700
Kitty Craig: And from Carl there he shared that.

267
00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:22.110
Kitty Craig: When he was like just reflecting kind of at the end of our interview he's like you know actually I feel like NPs stuff used to have a lot more economy than they do now local and I assumed, he was talking about like probably you.

268
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:30.390
Heather Ahndan: Sorry that's um yeah a lot of conversations as best over beers maybe.

269
00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:38.490
Kitty Craig: yeah no sighs I was just like oh that's interesting and then just reflecting and looking at other reflections on.

270
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:45.690
Heather Ahndan: Oh that's true, we had a lot more autonomy, we also had a lot more staff at the local level right like when I started in 2004 we had.

271
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:50.010
Heather Ahndan: 20 staff between San Francisco and Seattle.

272
00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:57.030
Heather Ahndan: And, and I signed grant applications like I could make those decisions and.

273
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:06.900
Heather Ahndan: I was empowered by my boss, and his boss, you know we would talk things over there, there was something controversial but and and i've looked at.

274
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:17.460
Heather Ahndan: And i'm not exaggerating i've looked at 6000 files in our region and that's pretty consistently how the program was drawn it was very it was meant to be very.

275
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.440
Heather Ahndan: Locally driven.

276
00:37:24.030 --> 00:37:30.000
Heather Ahndan: And that really shifted in the 16 well really in the last six years or so, eight years that I was there.

277
00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:37.290
Heather Ahndan: When I left there was one and a half of US between San Francisco and Seattle and.

278
00:37:39.810 --> 00:37:44.070
Heather Ahndan: And and many layers of leadership had left and.

279
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:54.090
Heather Ahndan: A lot more at DC was really interested in consolidating everything into DC and and running the program out of DC similar to the way the.

280
00:37:55.320 --> 00:38:11.970
Heather Ahndan: http F grants around the historic preservation HP historic preservation grants or run out of DC and DC I think got pushed back on that i'm not sure if they would contact characterize it is wanting to consolidate instead what they did was collapse into omaha and Atlanta for.

281
00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:20.310
Heather Ahndan: cost savings, but if you actually look at the numbers it wasn't, at least for Seattle.

282
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.380
Heather Ahndan: anyway.

283
00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:32.940
Heather Ahndan: Lots of reasons consistency, like in the name of trying to make things fair and equal and consistent, I think, personally, that is one of those things you get out with staff training and.

284
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:36.900
Heather Ahndan: resources and guidance, not by.

285
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:39.450
Heather Ahndan: micromanaging but.

286
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:43.650
Heather Ahndan: yeah maybe that's enough.

287
00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:45.540
Kitty Craig: not helpful context.

288
00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:47.580
numbers.

289
00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:49.530
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah Thank you.

290
00:38:51.990 --> 00:39:04.170
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): next question is, how does King county engage with a Community through the oral the application process, what are the typical Community engagement steps and working with poor or economically disadvantaged communities.

291
00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:04.860
yeah.

292
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:15.780
Heather Ahndan: i'm going to pin that for a second and go back to my numbers that I shared that not all those rough T right like an end that included admin stuff as well as leadership, so I just want to clarify that wasn't all like project management stuff.

293
00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:32.880
Heather Ahndan: yeah if you look way back like pre Reagan administration, the this that's what we like a lot of but anyway okay So how do we engage for Community engagement, we have a lot of a lot of pathways for committee engagement we actually recently launched.

294
00:39:33.810 --> 00:39:41.760
Heather Ahndan: A whole internal initiative to try to get us all to coordinate, because what we're hearing from communities they're exhausted by how much can counties going out and asking them for input.

295
00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:53.760
Heather Ahndan: So trying to be better coordinated, but specifically for overlap process, we have a few things we rely on we have.

296
00:39:55.230 --> 00:40:03.780
Heather Ahndan: An open space equity cabinet who helped us who really worked to set those criteria what around what counts is underserved and set priorities and a process for.

297
00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:22.290
Heather Ahndan: Doing that they also set a process for updating our code around how our funding streams prioritize those projects, and then we have an internal competitive process for those funding streams that we use this match on overlap so there's a separate body of Community.

298
00:40:23.940 --> 00:40:28.650
Heather Ahndan: reviewers that review project specific stuff.

299
00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:31.740
Heather Ahndan: And once those projects.

300
00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.890
Heather Ahndan: Well, even before those projects are completed we're in the Community, trying to figure out where they want projects.

301
00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:47.820
Heather Ahndan: Within those areas that have been established by the open space equity cabinet at the Community level, a lot of that's red led by our department of local services for unincorporated county.

302
00:40:49.530 --> 00:41:01.590
Heather Ahndan: And they have Community outreach around what they call sub area plans about Okay, you want more parks, where you want more parks, you know that sort of stuff so there's all of that sort of big strategic planning stuff.

303
00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:15.120
Heather Ahndan: And then, once the project is queued we do additional outreach around design and use and some of that traditional we like to do contract with Community based organizations to do the outreach.

304
00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:20.550
Heather Ahndan: Rather than through consulting firms, although we're also do it through consulting firms but.

305
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:25.740
Heather Ahndan: wanting to make sure, particularly for our equity facing projects that were centering the voices of community.

306
00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:39.510
Heather Ahndan: And that's usually best through a Community based organization that's already embedded in that Community and not some consultant that we've hired so they're their consultants, but consultant from the Community, instead of like a national organization that makes sense.

307
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.840
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah definitely I know in California, they do some.

308
00:41:45.870 --> 00:41:47.310
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Similar things just like.

309
00:41:47.370 --> 00:41:56.220
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): You have to have like one Community based partner or something like that um I don't know for parks, but for like climate related projects California does that and then excuse me.

310
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.830
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Okay.

311
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:11.310
Heather Ahndan: Or is yeah and are on our funding side, like our match source requires letters of recommendation from Community for those projects before we even award match that we would then use to compete for overlap.

312
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:16.440
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah yeah that's definitely great.

313
00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:24.330
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): way yeah throw in terms of Community engagement in comparison definitely to other places and.

314
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:34.470
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Then our next question is uh what grant programs or other initiatives as King county utilize that overlap or align with orla on goals in terms of increasing outdoor recreation.

315
00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:44.100
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): To urban economically disadvantaged and or underserved communities and how well do they work and do they have features that can be applied to or look.

316
00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.150
Heather Ahndan: I would take a look at our equity and social justice strategic.

317
00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:59.460
Heather Ahndan: plan I think that's really foundational and looking upstream at what creates a healthy Community parks is pretty solidly featured there obviously land conservation initiative and the companion.

318
00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:09.360
Heather Ahndan: open space equity cabinet report that came out of that I, you know, we also have like our parks opens based plan.

319
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:13.260
Heather Ahndan: that's more targeted at our CEO requirements.

320
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:21.960
Heather Ahndan: I think our strategic climate action plan also particularly frontline communities chapter section has some really important work.

321
00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:29.700
Heather Ahndan: That could inform this thinking about resiliency and he islands and some of that alignment and overlap.

322
00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:41.430
Heather Ahndan: We have recently hired a new green jobs coordinator and he's going to be putting out a strategy, so we don't have it yet, but we will have a green jobs strategy that's specifically about aligning.

323
00:43:44.070 --> 00:43:48.960
Heather Ahndan: Community and our open space work and part of that will be parks, not all of it.

324
00:43:51.660 --> 00:44:00.450
Heather Ahndan: We have a lot a lot, when I was reading that part of our application i'm like oh yeah and we have this, we have a lot of strategic plans or lap goals.

325
00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:13.050
Heather Ahndan: I mean, I think there's opportunities to like we probably could do more with our capital design standards and naming conventions and some of that kind of work.

326
00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:15.360
Heather Ahndan: Thinking about equity.

327
00:44:16.530 --> 00:44:17.070
Heather Ahndan: I think.

328
00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:20.520
Heather Ahndan: One of the pieces that often is missing.

329
00:44:21.810 --> 00:44:30.750
Heather Ahndan: Or could be strengthened in thinking about equity is a lot of its race driven, which is important work and improving equity for.

330
00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:36.960
Heather Ahndan: You know, helps float boat I think when it comes to capital in particular.

331
00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.140
Heather Ahndan: disability access is a different.

332
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:51.810
Heather Ahndan: The needs are different and so that's a component that I don't know, maybe it needs to be scored separately, I think it's a both and you need both and for the best projects and.

333
00:44:52.950 --> 00:45:00.510
Heather Ahndan: and on disability so much of that's driven by people who use mobility devices right but that's a small fraction of your.

334
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:05.460
Heather Ahndan: Your users that have disabilities so thinking of universally.

335
00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:11.400
Heather Ahndan: I think there's opportunities there for us to embed that more in our planning.

336
00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:29.880
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah definitely the Ada accessibility requirements we have heard come up a lot just because it does seem like it's been forgotten about in terms of parks and it's we heard a lot, I think, from Massachusetts they were doing some work around them, accessibility and parks and outdoor recreation.

337
00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.360
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And then, our next question is.

338
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:43.740
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): What have you used for the other, the 50% match and one do you secure this money funding and then there's any issues with holding on to this match.

339
00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:46.530
Heather Ahndan: So are.

340
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.060
Heather Ahndan: Our biggest source of funding.

341
00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:54.150
Heather Ahndan: Is conservation futures, which is state authorized and 14 counties rely on it.

342
00:45:56.670 --> 00:46:02.190
Heather Ahndan: The challenges that it's it's restricted to acquisition and only for passive recreation for us.

343
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:08.100
Heather Ahndan: I mean that's what the state code says so that's how we use it.

344
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:17.160
Heather Ahndan: The challenge isn't so much holding on the funding for that pot of funding there's holding on to funding challenges with other parts.

345
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:24.750
Heather Ahndan: are challenges really around timing for acquisition and and the what we're finding is that.

346
00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.640
Heather Ahndan: The the cost of land.

347
00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:43.860
Heather Ahndan: To use that as a match source is increasing, like in the three years that will wait like already so the the orla project that we just applied for last year that we're waiting to hear back on.

348
00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.430
Heather Ahndan: I forgot what it was appraised Alec $2 million.

349
00:46:49.740 --> 00:47:06.660
Heather Ahndan: This year she's competing for more funding from conservation features because it's already gone up another like in the six months it's another like half million dollars, by the time park service signs that project it's probably going to go up another you know million or so and so.

350
00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:13.350
Heather Ahndan: That that's the bigger challenge, I think, for us is that we only have acquisition funding to use this match.

351
00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:20.760
Heather Ahndan: And we have to, we need to leverage it for development dollars, because otherwise, that person is going to sit there.

352
00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:31.920
Heather Ahndan: Not programmed for that Community that's not meeting their needs it's I mean it's helping like it sort of heat island and there'll be some you know people can go there it'll be fine, but it won't be programmed.

353
00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:44.250
Heather Ahndan: If we try to use other funding sources like if we just go for our CEO funding or some other you know source of funding, then timing is, I think, a challenge.

354
00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:52.140
Heather Ahndan: Just from the you have to use these dollars by this time kind of lineup but for us most of our funding sources are.

355
00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:54.390
Heather Ahndan: Conservation futures.

356
00:47:58.230 --> 00:47:59.400
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah that's great Thank you.

357
00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:12.540
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): And I think our last question will be if you had one asked for MPs are our CEO regarding olivia for the program what would this ask be.

358
00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.150
Heather Ahndan: ooh.

359
00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:19.830
Heather Ahndan: I worry, because as soon as I say it they're gonna be like oh that comes from heather even if my name is not.

360
00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:22.530
Heather Ahndan: leader, yes.

361
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:25.380
Heather Ahndan: lead with yes rate lead with yes.

362
00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:34.230
Heather Ahndan: nobody's trying like nobody's going nobody is going through these grant processes trying to pull one over on the federal government like.

363
00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:53.790
Heather Ahndan: it's that's just not a thing nobody's trying to scam money this way it's to like there's so many easier ways to do it right, so the like the projects going in here are genuinely trying to do good in the world, so can like meet them halfway like help us get.

364
00:48:54.960 --> 00:49:08.190
Heather Ahndan: Okay, if it's wrong great let's just fix it, you know yeah tell us how to fix it you see what we're trying to do conceptually like grade the concept and then help us get to where it needs to be for it to be a yes.

365
00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:28.560
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah Thank you, I mean one of the things that we got to assist you're worried is like one of the State police officers was like just more kindness and application process of showing more Gray, showing more kindness, so I definitely think yeah that is a theme we're saying.

366
00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:35.820
Heather Ahndan: that's a real shift in NPs I mean back to what Carl was saying.

367
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:36.660
yeah.

368
00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:39.960
Heather Ahndan: it's a shift in culture.

369
00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:46.650
Heather Ahndan: And the really old timers will tell you that it started when they moved into NPs from outer.

370
00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:54.360
Heather Ahndan: It used to be their own bureau right so so these programs used to run out of the Bureau of outdoor recreation.

371
00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:02.940
Heather Ahndan: And many of the old timers, of which I think only the person left was my most recent boss.

372
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:06.330
Heather Ahndan: he's been there, like 55 years.

373
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:23.820
Heather Ahndan: When they moved into park service, there was a lot of animosity on both sides, they didn't want to go park service didn't want them and so that's been a big shift, I think, starting with.

374
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:35.370
Heather Ahndan: Really, starting with the second Bush administration saw a lot more embracing from park service of this being central to their mission.

375
00:50:36.510 --> 00:50:37.410
Heather Ahndan: This work.

376
00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.350
Heather Ahndan: Before they were kind of referred to as the outhouse programs.

377
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:49.290
Heather Ahndan: But with that comes additional.

378
00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:56.160
Heather Ahndan: You know I don't know accountability all of it and the name of accountability, but more accountability means less flexibility.

379
00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:00.240
Heather Ahndan: I would say in the 50 whatever years of the Program.

380
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:16.080
Heather Ahndan: Like it I don't know how they really had a significant audit finding I mean, probably, but on the ground has it me I don't know anyway, I think it's just it's that shift like toward more accountability and more.

381
00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:22.380
Heather Ahndan: brings less flexibility more centralization less regional of autonomy.

382
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:25.140
Kitty Craig: Like that simple.

383
00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:27.000
Kitty Craig: yeah.

384
00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:29.160
Kitty Craig: i'm.

385
00:51:31.230 --> 00:51:33.210
Kitty Craig: heather I know we're at the top of the hour.

386
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:35.940
Kitty Craig: Do you by chance, have any more time.

387
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:38.070
Heather Ahndan: I do my next appointment is not told to.

388
00:51:38.610 --> 00:51:39.750
Kitty Craig: Okay, not.

389
00:51:39.810 --> 00:51:43.680
Heather Ahndan: not going to give you, hopefully not if not i'm gonna be like let's go for lunch.

390
00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.740
Kitty Craig: we're gonna do you think you could ask a couple more questions are you okay with that.

391
00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:50.790
yeah.

392
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.500
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): um do you want me to let you take the lead on like which.

393
00:51:56.550 --> 00:51:57.840
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): additional questions you would like.

394
00:51:58.350 --> 00:52:09.870
Kitty Craig: yeah I just thought we kind of have three and maybe they can also be follow up kind of more more things, but there are a couple that I thought you might be able to provide some yeah more.

395
00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:24.720
Kitty Craig: More perspective on and i'm Thank you in advance, and I think that this is again kind of i'll start with this big picture, one, but I think one reflection that area on, and I have had has been around.

396
00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:43.080
Kitty Craig: States that have really well functioning high functioning i'd say our CEOs like the our CEOs you know which I guess we've talked to state park California state parks and and our CEO and probably Massachusetts I guess I it seems like those are pretty high functioning offices.

397
00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:57.450
Kitty Craig: So it seems like they can provide a more consistent and like positive experience for applicants in the oil process and in some ways, like ariana and I reflecting on our conversation with la county where someone's like state parks is like this buffer.

398
00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:01.110
Kitty Craig: places buffering role that.

399
00:53:02.550 --> 00:53:10.530
Kitty Craig: They you know, which is a good thing, but I just i'm just curious about now that the other bcf.

400
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:20.400
Kitty Craig: You know, has 9,000,900 million dollars available like a lot more money you know what is it in your sense, what does that mean for state administration about the UCF France and does the.

401
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:31.650
Kitty Craig: park service or federal government just need to provide more support to ensure more successful implementation, you know more equitably across the country like give me just perspective on that kind of big picture.

402
00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:41.880
Heather Ahndan: yeah I think admin funding has been a real challenge and the way that the state's get funding for admin has also been one of those things that changed in the last six years or so.

403
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:51.990
Heather Ahndan: Really pie eight years by now I don't want to make it it wasn't it's not specific to any administration, so let me say that it's its internal to NPs.

404
00:53:54.630 --> 00:54:04.350
Heather Ahndan: there's not a great mechanism so this program is unique in the world of federal grant funding, because of the administrative burden it's.

405
00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:11.760
Heather Ahndan: perpetual and there's not a good way of capturing that in a grant so in most cases there's like like with our tp there's an.

406
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:27.780
Heather Ahndan: admin rate that gets attached to grants and there's sort of a flat fee and that works, because those are finite projects, meaning your your administration of that project is within the context of that construction.

407
00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:38.160
Heather Ahndan: The difference with elder bcf is that there's that piece and they're also running all the grant rounds and providing all the technical assistance and.

408
00:54:38.490 --> 00:54:50.340
Heather Ahndan: inspecting all the projects and if there's a problem on one of the project, it could be hundreds of thousands of dollars of staff time to resolve that project for a pretty small grant like I mean think about.

409
00:54:51.180 --> 00:55:01.200
Heather Ahndan: Think about all the administration that went into this David 520 expansion into the arboretum and how much those agencies spent on that there was a $65,000 grant rate so.

410
00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:07.110
Heather Ahndan: there's no way for them to capture that right now, and so.

411
00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:16.290
Heather Ahndan: I think many of them D staffed when the program was zero funded they haven't had a chance to catch backup now that there's more funding that takes a few years right they have to get F T.

412
00:55:16.710 --> 00:55:24.060
Heather Ahndan: I think it's a different climate like there's just not a lot of political support and people support for staffing up government like.

413
00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:41.640
Heather Ahndan: that's not happening right nobody's saying like let's bring back robust administration like it was pre Reagan are happening so, even if they have the money they can't spend it on staff were saying that, even at the local level to and so.

414
00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:57.120
Heather Ahndan: I don't know like I think finding some way to slide administrative funding to them directly, maybe, based on a portion of their portion not having to go through a grant application, because they did a direct grant in 2005 that wasn't very successful.

415
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:10.830
Heather Ahndan: and making that funding flexible like sure you can use it for inspections or staff or F T or hiring contractors, or whatever they need to do it with not being so prescriptive.

416
00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:19.470
Kitty Craig: We definitely heard that and I guess you provided detail on that.

417
00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:21.600
Heather Ahndan: email a couple weeks ago to on this topic.

418
00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:27.120
Kitty Craig: And I think I shared that that was sparked by our conversation with Illinois was like.

419
00:56:27.930 --> 00:56:40.350
Kitty Craig: One, it was a staffing issue like she wanted she's like I don't understand why you can't get additional administrative funding like you do from two different pitman Robertson and an arch in our Department of Transportation.

420
00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:44.010
Kitty Craig: Like why can't we do this.

421
00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:49.320
Kitty Craig: For for all the vcs and then and then also reflecting on.

422
00:56:50.550 --> 00:56:52.980
Kitty Craig: This is a maybe a Jason issue.

423
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:58.140
Kitty Craig: The land encumbrance issue with all the vcs.

424
00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:06.450
Kitty Craig: Funding just being really a turnoff for jurisdictions within your jurisdiction, say, sir.

425
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:26.040
Heather Ahndan: I think that's true up to a point yeah right like practitioners on the ground secretly are very much in favor of that I cannot tell you the number of times that i've had anonymous calls from staff, you know when I was MPs.

426
00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:28.380
Heather Ahndan: About hey i'm getting a lot of pressure from the.

427
00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:38.760
Heather Ahndan: mayor to do this thing and we don't want to give up our park or the Community doesn't want us to give up our park and i'm not going to build his brother in law's condos here help me out or.

428
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:47.550
Heather Ahndan: I mean that's really it's really common or with federal agencies, like you know federal highways, in particular kind of a.

429
00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:56.040
Heather Ahndan: While it's just empty space, who cares if we put a it'll be so much better like literally sitting in the West Seattle light rail.

430
00:57:56.730 --> 00:58:02.640
Heather Ahndan: Somebody told me it'll be so much better if we can put the light rail through the golf course because then we could do this really cool pavilion.

431
00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:13.980
Heather Ahndan: Like no, you cannot put it through the golf course in Camp long it's up or no but, like their perspective is well it's just this old park it's just a lot of empty space and we can make this really cool thing.

432
00:58:15.870 --> 00:58:22.380
Heather Ahndan: So it's having a voice at the table that's at the equivalence table level that is helpful because otherwise a small.

433
00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:31.470
Heather Ahndan: or parks, is at the bottom of the political spectrum and most jurisdictions right like I mean i've sat at a table with the fire chief.

434
00:58:32.460 --> 00:58:45.270
Heather Ahndan: Who wants to take over the park for their new fire station complaining with this is not this is so hard, how come it's so hard for me to take your part for my fire station me it's not supposed to be easy that's why this is in place, this is why right here.

435
00:58:45.660 --> 00:58:45.930
You.

436
00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:47.760
Heather Ahndan: So.

437
00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:51.540
Heather Ahndan: So I think we need to be careful about.

438
00:58:55.980 --> 00:59:01.890
Heather Ahndan: About weakening the the strength, what I have seen again in the past eight years.

439
00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:20.340
Heather Ahndan: Is that park service is interpreted itself to be a lot more restrictive about what counts as what counts as supporting outdoor recreation, what counts is compatible with outdoor recreation, I think they have a tremendous amount of flexibility, and that has really shifted.

440
00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:24.240
Heather Ahndan: So you know before.

441
00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:30.810
Heather Ahndan: If we wanted to do an indoor pool or Community Center REC Center or.

442
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:37.380
Heather Ahndan: An interpretive Center that stuff was a lot cabins easier.

443
00:59:38.730 --> 00:59:41.400
Heather Ahndan: The oversight requirements have gotten a lot more.

444
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:45.090
Heather Ahndan: And in the companion piece of that is that.

445
00:59:48.300 --> 01:00:03.660
Heather Ahndan: groups are using that federal nexus to subject local decisions to federal regulations that I don't think it's intended so they're using it as a hammer to make section 106 requirements stick in a way that they wouldn't.

446
01:00:04.710 --> 01:00:06.630
Heather Ahndan: I don't know I mean a nepa same thing.

447
01:00:07.110 --> 01:00:11.220
Heather Ahndan: it's it's it's tying it to those two so it's making things more complicated than it used to be.

448
01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:21.480
Heather Ahndan: So I don't know that it's the lw cf restrictions that are so much it's the pieces that go with it, that are challenging.

449
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.950
ooh.

450
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:30.360
Heather Ahndan: But I don't think he answers to get rid of the other bcf requirements, the answers administrative to say.

451
01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:36.780
Heather Ahndan: You know these only apply in this context, or they don't apply it off it's a local decision or something.

452
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.780
Kitty Craig: Like that yeah that sounds like.

453
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.180
Kitty Craig: la county was working through these negotiations, right now, because there they got.

454
01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:47.310
Kitty Craig: They got our funding.

455
01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:52.230
Kitty Craig: For a trail that goes through kind of a cultural events.

456
01:00:53.370 --> 01:01:02.430
Kitty Craig: area their area cultural Center, I guess, they would call it um and sounded very challenging to kind of reconcile the two like.

457
01:01:02.970 --> 01:01:13.440
Kitty Craig: The flexibility they need to operate cultural events you know this historic theater and those kinds of things, but then you know to be NPs is requirements fine that's kind of interesting case.

458
01:01:13.830 --> 01:01:27.810
Heather Ahndan: yeah that's all administrative and the really frustrating thing is it's not documented and it changes and it's really it all comes down to like one or two people you know there's not a that sort of top down that lack of flexibility, instead of it being a.

459
01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:39.750
Heather Ahndan: You know, a negotiation we're state, whoever they are CEO of the world and the local agency will sit down with MPs and will come to some kind of agreement it's really just coming down to what he says.

460
01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:49.320
Kitty Craig: Okay well that's this is then of course lightning.

461
01:01:50.700 --> 01:02:01.710
Heather Ahndan: Alright, I hope I hope I don't sound like i'm airing dirty laundry i'm not i'm trying to give you what's helpful context, without like i'm not trying to throw anybody under the bus, but I think some of this doesn't let's.

462
01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:05.580
Heather Ahndan: I don't some of those things where you're like why.

463
01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:17.490
Heather Ahndan: Why is this different or why, how come NPs does it this way, but all the other federal agencies do it that way, when you see those things it comes down to stuff.

464
01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:20.640
Heather Ahndan: yeah it comes down to DC stuff.

465
01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:22.650
Kitty Craig: yeah that's a fascinating and then.

466
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:23.910
Kitty Craig: Just to have people there in those.

467
01:02:23.910 --> 01:02:27.840
Kitty Craig: positions for so long, and then the problem remains their problem or whatever.

468
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:33.690
Kitty Craig: So it's just been so fascinating to kind of kill this onion away.

469
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:49.230
Kitty Craig: um well I, it would be great i'd love to we will definitely keep you informed as this process, progressive and area and i'll share i'll let your eyes close out as she normally does, but I also want to maybe.

470
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:54.120
Kitty Craig: If there's an opportunity to kind of come back I don't know probably more to the end of the month or.

471
01:02:54.720 --> 01:03:06.030
Kitty Craig: Getting a next month, because I think one thing that Ariane or Brett and I are grappling with which is like Okay, what are some of these barriers that we've uncovered that can be addressed legislative but that need to be addressed legislatively versus that kind of.

472
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:18.300
Kitty Craig: Administrative discretion and would love to have some of your expertise and helping us maybe to some of these things out because that seems to be really fascinating Gray area and.

473
01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:23.850
Kitty Craig: We fascinating to hear what we hear from the park service we're going to meet the park Service staff at the end of the month.

474
01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:30.450
Heather Ahndan: And they're new or that person I don't have never met she was hired after I.

475
01:03:31.170 --> 01:03:31.530
Kitty Craig: Okay.

476
01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:45.600
Heather Ahndan: they've had a lot of turnover in the DC Office like the chief in the deputy have stayed consistent over the last eight years or whatever it's been but the rest of the DC stuff I think has been there's been a lot of turnover.

477
01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:48.570
Kitty Craig: And Bob ratcliffe.

478
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.740
Kitty Craig: Does that name ring a bell.

479
01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:53.580
Heather Ahndan: yeah okay well sorry now, I have to air some dirty laundry.

480
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:56.820
Heather Ahndan: so stupid it's so stupid okay.

481
01:03:57.150 --> 01:04:03.960
Heather Ahndan: The Bob radcliffe is over, so in the in the directorship the partnership and civic engagement.

482
01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:06.630
Heather Ahndan: branch of NPs.

483
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:08.610
Heather Ahndan: There are.

484
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:13.830
Heather Ahndan: I think there's three three pillars let's say.

485
01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:19.110
Heather Ahndan: there's conservation and outdoor recreation that's Bob ratcliffe shop.

486
01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:26.070
Heather Ahndan: there's state and local assistance that still lunches shop and then there's hydro power.

487
01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:32.880
Heather Ahndan: wild and scenic and rivers and i'm not sure what they call that and i'm not sure this is still true this is this was sort of.

488
01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:36.450
Heather Ahndan: shoot when was this.

489
01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.110
Heather Ahndan: Pre Obama end of.

490
01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.020
Heather Ahndan: The Bush anyway.

491
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:46.740
Heather Ahndan: So Bob radcliffe's T.

492
01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:05.820
Heather Ahndan: amen and the Federal and perks stuff they do not get along.

493
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:15.900
Heather Ahndan: And so that's delicate just know that there's a there's tension there about who's poaching, whose portfolio and whose job is this anyway and.

494
01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:19.080
Kitty Craig: When you say they do you mean those individuals.

495
01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:20.040
Heather Ahndan: Those individuals.

496
01:05:21.330 --> 01:05:22.260
Kitty Craig: how incredibly productive.

497
01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:27.600
Heather Ahndan: at the regional level, we were like here in Seattle we were co located under the same supervisor.

498
01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:28.200
Kitty Craig: and work.

499
01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:33.810
Heather Ahndan: Fair and I thought was unique none of the other offices operated like that, but, but that was.

500
01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:45.540
Heather Ahndan: We worked as we're all in the Community, working together one of us is strategic planning and one of us is funding let's be part of the same team anyway, but.

501
01:05:47.520 --> 01:05:50.700
Heather Ahndan: Anyway, so there's some tension there and part of that comes from like.

502
01:05:52.320 --> 01:06:00.720
Heather Ahndan: There was, it was a period of time, where one shop was another UCF I think was taken out of that portfolio and putting somebody else's portfolio and then came back and.

503
01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:06.330
Heather Ahndan: Anyway, so just know that Bob does not speak for Joel and Joel does not speak for Bob maybe.

504
01:06:07.890 --> 01:06:09.540
Heather Ahndan: Maybe we should have stopped recording this.

505
01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:26.220
Kitty Craig: No that's so interesting well Bob was me we just you know I carry on and I love rbc folks matt with Bob work with Bob I guess and his team closely and lots of other stuff to recreation policy permitting you know that world.

506
01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:31.680
Kitty Craig: And so, who he is, and then we got on to some issues.

507
01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:40.350
Kitty Craig: conversation around 30 by 30 and justice 40 and, like all these things that are going on, Bob has all sorts of ideas, wants to be a connector.

508
01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:46.860
Kitty Craig: Yes, like what is probably his last years months left in the Agency and, just like wants to share.

509
01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:51.450
Heather Ahndan: he's very much a connector like he sees putting all these things together and.

510
01:06:51.570 --> 01:06:52.890
Heather Ahndan: yeah and.

511
01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:58.350
Heather Ahndan: Yes, yeah he's really strategic about that.

512
01:06:58.890 --> 01:06:59.430
Heather Ahndan: You know it's a.

513
01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:04.350
Kitty Craig: ginger enjoying that call but there's probably a reason why don't enjoy.

514
01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:08.820
Heather Ahndan: I don't know, maybe he's just busy like maybe that's not even that's totally gossip.

515
01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:13.980
Heather Ahndan: Right like i'm sorry that's not very professional of me, but I just I would be I guess i'd be careful about.

516
01:07:16.830 --> 01:07:20.160
Heather Ahndan: Knowing that you should talk to both like one side of substitute for the other.

517
01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:28.140
Kitty Craig: yeah i'm hopeful that, when I know that area, my who is who has committed to that MPs interview I think it's ginger and Elizabeth.

518
01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:33.180
Heather Ahndan: Elizabeth speaks virtual I would say they're pretty in lockstep they take it on very well.

519
01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:37.680
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah so far just ginger and of Elizabeth.

520
01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:42.540
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah I don't think I definitely have not followed up with Bob about anything.

521
01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:47.640
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): However, he does seem like he wanted to be a resource, especially in terms of GIs.

522
01:07:48.390 --> 01:07:58.470
Kitty Craig: yeah yeah he's really interested in this this just issue of how do we define the communities that need our support, you know they're getting a mandate from the administration to do that.

523
01:07:59.010 --> 01:08:07.470
Kitty Craig: don't really have a place to start you know, and that applies to where where should we be directing oil keep funding where should we be directing rtc services, you know.

524
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:16.620
Heather Ahndan: I don't I don't think they need to start from scratch like trust Republic land has already done this work go talk to them like that's they've already done this.

525
01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:30.450
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah kendra definitely wants us to talk to trust her public land your gave us some contact and I know right there they're like a park score not bending something but.

526
01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:32.100
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): We shall see.

527
01:08:33.690 --> 01:08:42.840
Kitty Craig: yeah we don't need to create so okay well, this has been extraordinarily helpful heather everyone I ended up to you to close close up.

528
01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:52.230
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah i'll Thank you so much for participating i'll send up a follow up interview with just how you'd like to be attributed in the report we have any follow up questions.

529
01:08:52.950 --> 01:09:08.940
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): will definitely keep you and I will be creating a report by like the end of spring also along with hopefully like a one pager of our findings and recommendations and then seems like we also will hopefully get a follow up meeting on potential recommendations.

530
01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:17.490
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): yeah but just thank you so much for your time and if you have any follow up questions or any questions feel free to email me, let me know right now.

531
01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:29.790
Heather Ahndan: No just thank you for doing this work and my goal is always just to make this better and more accessible and make sure we're getting these projects on the ground for the people who need them the most so anything I can do to help support this i'm 100%.

532
01:09:30.360 --> 01:09:36.480
Heather Ahndan: committed, so please feel free to reach out if you have more questions, and thank you for keeping this anonymous so I can be very candid.

533
01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:38.910
Heather Ahndan: and

534
01:09:39.450 --> 01:09:41.220
Heather Ahndan: And kind of trust right.

535
01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:51.690
Heather Ahndan: I I think everybody wants us to be good and work and it's just a matter of figuring out how we can all get there in a way that works for everybody yeah.

536
01:09:51.780 --> 01:10:03.930
Ariana Hernandez (she/hers): Definitely, a lot of our interviews have been very candid, so I think yeah definitely this summarize anonymized feature of this report will be it's been helpful just to learn what's working and what isn't truly.

537
01:10:04.950 --> 01:10:10.920
Kitty Craig: yeah and I think one thing has been awesome is that we've been able to dig deeper like city parks alliance.

538
01:10:11.220 --> 01:10:17.340
Kitty Craig: did some surveying of its members on Orlando, for example, which I think we had talked about how their meeting to share information.

539
01:10:17.970 --> 01:10:32.040
Kitty Craig: And like their number one finding was like man people just don't know about the program you know, like it is communication, you know just an awareness there's an awareness issue, but as we've been digging into these interview there's like a lot of procedural.

540
01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:35.520
Kitty Craig: issues with this program.

541
01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:37.560
Kitty Craig: That I mean.

542
01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.530
Kitty Craig: Before you even address the awareness problem.

543
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:50.250
Kitty Craig: We got to fix the program first before we like advertise it to the world that you know this awesome program exists, so we want you.

544
01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:52.560
Kitty Craig: To apply, because it seems like there are.

545
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:54.840
Kitty Craig: very fast.

546
01:10:56.490 --> 01:11:03.390
Heather Ahndan: yeah yeah hundred percent and I don't I don't think the States or the park services they don't have the capacity, yet for it to.

547
01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:07.950
Heather Ahndan: yeah have a whole bunch of new applicants probably.

548
01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:21.090
Kitty Craig: Will and then meanwhile in DC everybody's talking about how great program is advocating for more money so gets more and more and more appropriations, which is sucking some of the money away from state and local.

549
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:27.690
Kitty Craig: it's a local program as well, and in reality and not all those programs run great across the country, but it seems like those are.

550
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:32.430
Heather Ahndan: A plant one more seed, which is, I wonder why.

551
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:38.400
Heather Ahndan: You are 2.0 all the times that it's been re.

552
01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:46.110
Heather Ahndan: introduced as a concept has been setting with hud and there may be real.

553
01:11:48.060 --> 01:11:57.180
Heather Ahndan: I just don't know i'm curious about the thought process that went into putting it into hud instead of in park service and whether there's anything there that informs.

554
01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:00.090
Heather Ahndan: This is hud.

555
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:06.270
Heather Ahndan: Is he doing such a great job of running cdb G or whatever it is that makes.

556
01:12:07.890 --> 01:12:16.920
Heather Ahndan: It attractive to put because you are function this way right, this is how you are used to go national competition that went up through local like this is very much how you part was structured.

557
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:26.520
Heather Ahndan: So are there lessons learned from today that might be relevant to how we amplifier or implement or codify or a lap I don't know.

558
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:36.660
Kitty Craig: One follow up to that would you say the venue part was just absorbed by like the commute this TV program is that what it is artists it separately.

559
01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:45.390
Heather Ahndan: know you are like a little bcf went with zero funding for some number of years, but unlike you all to be safe, never got re it.

560
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.950
Heather Ahndan: It doesn't.

561
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:53.220
Heather Ahndan: I don't know why it just didn't get re and then it got dropped from the register so there's still like.

562
01:12:54.330 --> 01:13:02.010
Heather Ahndan: there's still the perpetual protections on the site that are required park service administers that but there hasn't been any grant funding for since 2000 maybe.

563
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:03.330
Heather Ahndan: yeah so.

564
01:13:07.770 --> 01:13:19.380
Heather Ahndan: It could be addressed by Orlando and I think I said this in the legislative simply by adding the ability to do indoor so the two differences between or lapping up or is that it funded indoor recreation.

565
01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:23.190
Heather Ahndan: It and it funded programming.

566
01:13:25.050 --> 01:13:28.380
Heather Ahndan: And the other difference is that it can be passed through from.

567
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:37.260
Heather Ahndan: There was no State intermediary so like Tacoma, for example, past their grant funding through to.

568
01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:41.820
Heather Ahndan: I don't know ymca and some housing groups and stuff like that nonprofits.

569
01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:55.620
Heather Ahndan: So maybe that's why it's going to hud or maybe it's just seen as more aligned with hud's mission I don't know or maybe they just like the way hud administer stuff or maybe ctg used to have perpetual responsibilities and that got struck.

570
01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:04.320
Heather Ahndan: So maybe it's that although when I look at the legislation for the I don't know what they're calling it but it's almost word for word, you are.

571
01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:08.550
Heather Ahndan: It still has the 1010 requirements that perpetual.

572
01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:09.480
Kitty Craig: So it.

573
01:14:09.750 --> 01:14:15.450
Heather Ahndan: didn't take them out so i'm not really sure i'm just curious if maybe there's some lessons learned from hud but be relevant.

574
01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:21.450
Kitty Craig: that's something to dig into more and they're actively like How does.

575
01:14:23.310 --> 01:14:33.840
Kitty Craig: there's some really incredible new programming proposed like in the build better I think i've shared some of that with you, before heather the Community revitalization and restoration fund like there's some really.

576
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:44.700
Kitty Craig: cool things I can do like to do a lot for parks and communities in different ways, know and we talked with staff, a long time ago.

577
01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:56.100
Kitty Craig: about that, and they were like really trying to take an intentional approach to how that program would be run at just like almost a fine best practices, which is something you don't necessarily think about what the federal government.

578
01:14:58.110 --> 01:15:03.210
Kitty Craig: it's like great we can do this right right out of the gates I need to follow one more.

579
01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.260
Kitty Craig: Okay now me too too long Thank you so much heather.

580
01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:15.000
Heather Ahndan: Thank you, or i've kept you too long, I blather on about a bunch of stuff so thanks for your i'm listening and for your work on this great.

581
01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:16.710
Kitty Craig: Good will definitely find.

582
01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:17.910
Heather Ahndan: All right, cheers.
